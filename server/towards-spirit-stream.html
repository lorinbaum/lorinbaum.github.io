<p>Share the process in truth to<br />
test, be surprised, dance, reproduce, join the cutting edge, offer, cohere, support, punish<br />

<ul>
<li>Scrape, filter</li>
<li>Writing and viewing bits that are grouped into "files" (patterns) along (at least) 3 axes: resolution, completion, age. These dimensions may use a:</li>
<li>General framework for organization: files, tags, paths lead to the overlap between files, folders/links (graph file sytem. tags that have tags,... that have links to files). Becomes circular through backlinks and possible references from inside the file. Allow linking anything. Images, text, make super easy.</li>
<li>Simple export into self contained copies</li>
<li>
<p>(opt.) version control: extend, branch, merge and view changes. Version history is a graph of graphs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>compile into optimized formats (HTML)</p>
</li>
<li>File encryption</li>
<li>Analytics + docs = Interface to the machine</li>
<li>
<p>Compatibility with most hardware to get closer to the user for convenience. (phone, emebedded devices)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>share on static server: SSH, HTTPS, IPFS(?), streaming (SRT?), API</p>
</li>
<li>Dynamic server: authenticate into permission groups + opt. meet conditions (paywall, forms, etc.) to view some content. APi should allow for relaying: Watching a stream from my site but my server is too slow to serve it? Relay to other people -&gt; take load of my server -&gt; get better connection yourself!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Next%20version">Next version</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>link based filesystem<br />
  files are folders linking to more files. have backlinks too. files are tags to the linked files. search through files shared by the target (links, or backlinks). give api to get size of files in a particular selection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>history can only exist per file and is an interface on top of the filesystem. links in files link to the latest version without specifying the version. if automatically generated / updated links change, note this in the commit api and optionally add those files to history.</p>
</li>
<li>Interface: programmatically produce list of backlinks! and forward links by search. some code generates one-time, as a shortcut. some generates every time the file is displayed. like link lists. create a code cell like in jupyter notebook. some display the code too.</li>
<li>text interface like cli: search bar, commands, answer questions</li>
<li>database stores links for faster access</li>
<li>.md -&gt; HTML<ul>
<li>inputs: path, (permission group)</li>
<li>settings: css, frame</li>
<li>(filter links to files outside permission (note this in cache))</li>
<li>convert md, put into frame</li>
<li>add css</li>
<li>output: html</li>

<code>make</code> files for easy compilation</p>
<p>non-hierarchical file system.<br />
bytes, pointers -&gt; pointers are bytes too and can store tags for their bytes.<br />
files, tags. Tags are files too. So, structure defined by links.<br />
How to navigate it?<br />
design an entry point, link files like obsidian already supports it. Wikipedia.<br />
Graph view is useless.<br />
search files by how they are connected.<br />
tags are unnecessary, they are literally a weak link<br />
navigate through forward and backward links.<br />
optionally select an overlap of multiple links. like ctrl-click to add to the group which must overlap.<br />
the backlink that I come from should be highlighted<br />
Information, however, becomes hierarchically organized as it matures. No problem. Hierachy is a subset of this system.<br />
converting from hierarchy is easy. converting to hierarchy requires disambiguation: which link(s) should become the files folder(s)? Mutltiple folders means the file is copied.<br />
drives are tags.<br />
branches are tags.<br />
snapshots from previous commits belong to the commit tag<br />
omg<br />
easy<br />
git gives UI for merging files and tags, like from pull requests or other branches.<br />
how to limit number of forward links while maintaining their precision? display them as searchable list. searchable also for overlap.</p>
<p>content addressing solves the streaming relay problem? Choose to relay and others automatically connect based on their connection cost.<br />
optionally pay for relay<br />
= IPFS, (filecoin(?))</p>
<p>messages are files automatically received and that I actively send out.<br />
can be (are) grouped under tags depending on sender.</p>

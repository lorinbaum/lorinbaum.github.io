There seems to be way living inward, but genuinely interesting things come from the unknown. And turning outward seems like a great adventure. Offer synchronization with my brain to the world. Offer trust through transparency. I'd love to see minds, imagine the possible depth.
Also curious where this leads: [Learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).

### Spirit stream evolution

#### Proto spirit stream

It aimed to be maximally accurate. I'm an opaque blob with some projects on the surface.
Who am I to categorize my project correctly? Instead, I dream of maps. They speak for themselves and display opportunity.
So projects are scattered over the surface, users were able to rotate the blob. The distance between them was determined by "connections" I set manually. Connected blobs attract each other and disconnected ones repell each other.
This was meant to lead to a visually quickly and intuitively understood blob distribution.

bigger spheres = more time spent on the project
brighter spheres = newer project
thumbnails of proximate spheres that act as buttons to the projects make them more distinct.

example for connections: Information about me (smol white dot) and the two rather personal works nearby seemed "connected" to me: they all give a more direct image of my mind.

![](/assets/pasted-image-20240123193439.png)

In the summary at the beginning of each project page, connected notes (neighbors) were referenced explitly to lay out the structure and provide further reading.

- No search engine optimization - all content was generated dynamically and undiscovered by crawlers
- requires javascript
- inefficient to use, relies on curiosity of visitor, needs to turn the blob to discover everything
- information structure too weak to support large number of projects at various levels of resolution (density, thought hours) and versions
	- low benefit from connections at high cost of visual complexity. imagine dozens of project bubbles

media format is not the point but is taking much attention and space. Too much information. More relevant is what area was changed, maybe what exactly was changed.

![](/assets/pasted-image-20240126212550.png)
history button is not necessary, rarely used I imagine.
click on "updated 10 hours ago" to see what exactly has changed in the last update. easy with `difflib`.

history page could get more stats, person on history page is looking for it
show *how much* each area changed and also show deletions
![](/assets/pasted-image-20240126212515.png)

version control
- record brain in action, not just result
- keep the current notes tidy without deleting anything forever
- show when something is new

better navigation. make it subtle on the side somehow. Mouseover to increase contrast?
collect some ideas online

2024-02-28 21:04 rant collection, the spirit stream SUCKS!
- where is the history?
- the newest update column provides only garbage information, who cares if I fixed a typo? It should reflect the actual content not an abstracted commit message I made up.
- why is git storing my files in this unreadable way?
- who decided to make links suddenly be red?
- why can't I tell when I already visited them?
- is it an external or internal link?
- can't tell the difference between headings
- who needs these lines between notes in the table?
- how do I see only what was recently changed?
- is this even streaming my spirits? then what is happening during all this downtime between updates? where is the spirit?
- where is the manifested streamer? where is my spider hat that records what I am experiencing directly?

### Note structure

- Why (without heading)
- Title
- list of contents (without heading)
- Direction
- more refined
- less refined - current thoughts, multiple different paths are explored, for more complete synchronization. 

## Less refined

### Spirit stream vision

stream = raw information I choose to share
spirit = meta being(s) behind the stream
Temple = access port to the spirits

1. the spirit stream expands the user into the digital world with minimal effort
2. It meets the reader where it can expand him

like a field where it is easy to identify parts that are newly planted and parts that are more grown
like a map that intuitively lays out potential and the path to it.
### Stream structure design

visitors should easily be able to 
- read
- quote
- pay
- contact
the host.

if using what someone else built is easy enough, cooperation is easy too without using shared files which requires negotiation to stay tidy. Instead, everyone builds their own stuff, reusing others' work, optionally paying for it.
in an information rich environment, betrayal and exploitation are easily detected and not worth it. simply need to spread information easily and offer easy ways to compensate someone.

conversation can be public too and seamlessly enter the spirit stream. if version history exists, conversations can be modified without hiding the truth.

1. I put out there what I build as I build it in whatever categories I prefer
2. people build on it, input information, quoting specificly or making a general comment. -> Inbox is another note and the response may quote part of another note
3. anyone may pay a contribution
4. version history shows changes, comments, deleted content

securely host quotable, changing information, maybe anonymously or almost anonymously, without requiring external services.


### Tech

From scratch
- all markdown features
- WYSIWYG interface
- nice url
- analytics
- comments
- Dynamic site support
- version control
- live stream (?)
- print markdown

- domain -> ip (cloudflare DNS-O-Matic?)
	- holds records to route different requests to different ips. can also route email traffic. records are cached and may point to old ip adress.
- webserver (apache)
- web app (flask)
	- generates html, caching after generating it
- WYSIWYG editor
	- markdown
	- templates
	- css
	- stream
- status viewer
	- traffic

disqus?
[Python modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)
jinja2 templates
plausible analytics
tor network
atom/rss
P2P websites
uploading to server: SSH vs SFTP

true spirit stream streams files of any kind to worldwide availability

From [Host website locally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euXdC0NDgac)
- XAMPP -> Apache, MySQL
- wordpress for content
- ~~packetriot for tunneling (?)~~ use [port forwarding](https://www.quora.com/Can-we-live-a-localhost-server-website-to-the-internet-If-so-how) instead

I use a soft overlay on some files to edit them. Publish. Enter a domain if I want to. And its out.
The overlay is easily understood.
Easily modified
```
markdown, mathjax, css
	.md ++
	.jpg  .png  .gif  .mp4  .mp3 ...
html, css, javascript -> machine version
    templates
```

servers sends markdown and everyone renders it as they wish?
I put out information, the llm filters it anyway

connect to form the hive mind
share experience and build an environment that is greatly supportive of what I want to do. A responsive environment, an overlay over reality to interface optimally with it.
it means finding information when I need it, offers, people, all this fast. Instant. Trust is information, no reason why the internet should destroy trust. elevate, augment and stream the spirit.

build a virtual clone
the llm interface to the world. it does not matter to output information in high quality, it is enough if it is there and readable by the llm.



hosting locally sucks because who lets their computer run 24/7? Who needs to host locally, if the content is public anyway?
hosting on an external computer requires trust and is usually more expensive than necessary. Free options exist but they require negotiation.

- local server that converts .md files when serving. with preview server.
	- integrate as much as possible: small computer, server software, local drive, 
- platform service. pay per bandwidth and compute. at cost with donations. implement whatever structure I like. become a registry too? or host on subdomain. repo\.github\.io or github\.io\/repo. People can buy their domain if they like.
	- google drive should also be a blogging platform
	- twitch should be a spirit stream
	- people can pay with microtransactions, reducing abstractions and forwarding the rules to the user

2: clone that scrapes the network and negotiates between people. Hand over control to the clones. Extend smoothly into real world, as machines are introduced that can extend the clones.
initially, information is stored on the central server. The system should be open enough such that there is a balance of power because the dying system could easily be salvaged, reproduced elsewhere.

hosting locally is also slow. copying to various servers is faster. decentralized. how does tor work?
data is distributed across many private servers? 
blockchain? web3?

get the spirits into the world. what is holding them back? negotiation? a virtual clone. sometimes it is not possible to stream

why would you want a clone? because it connects with people and ideas that are similar and allows to build rather than reinvent.

1. universal publisher (thoughts, experience, weather data, sale/purchase offers, private cloud,...)
	1. local server for anything
	2. desktop software as interface
	3. offer hosting
2. clone and autoscraper, so much potential to replace things
3. physical instantiation
4. accelerate towards independent AI

stream raw files, made web friendly if necessary

- Discord Server / Email contact like a cafe where people would meet me
	- fake aesthetik. discord server is what it functionally is. what is it? people will know?
	- how to make it easy to reach me and know that it is an actual place, not just a dead contact form?
- Guide gaze like in a painting, comprehensive visual impression
	- i wish. what is the structure of information? what is the map to represent the information. Was in a buddha museum recently. figures, reliefs. They spoke a language I didn't understand (the images) and it was accordingly boring. How to communicate in high resolution without aliening people and forming an "in group". Should be possible as information is ideally presented to each person differently based on past experience/knowlege/predisposition. 

where does the history graph go when notes are refactored? was it merged into somewhere else?

stream is continuous, repeats patterns from the past. the past is filtered and organized, the present it not always organized -> inbox
I am an information structuring engine
old, high res, crystallized structures are refined and references as we go
in them, the structures are hidden
like Joscha Bach does it

as information is refined, a few blocks of interest form.
they are reused and every new reuse is a different path through the same blocks connecting and testing them with other ideas and experiences.
they may fragment into smaller blocks to become more reusable
a path through the blocks that is the ultimate test of their consistency is a true story.
A true story is indistinguishable from life
a language model that has not learned to answer questions tells stories, but with low refinement. It recounts its experience given a prompt.
usually, describing individual blocks becomes too laborious and abstract, so the path through the blocks is the preferred medium.
an individual block and its environment might be represented in an artwork, aiming to maximize resolution around this area of the idea landscape.
If it is refined enough its essence will be recognized even by those who see the same block in lower resolution in their own thinking.
Perhaps this node will set off a story in the observer, automatically connecting itself in the observers network.
it has become an effective meme.

In math and physics perhaps such a block is a formula, a new tool to be applied. The stories it produces are its applications.
in mathematics, a game with strict rules (by my understanding), the truth of a block can be verified.

engineering, of which I mostly know programming, feels like branching off of a given path or some base of information in search of new paths.
Reverse engineering is starting from the fog and trying to find the branch of light to clear it.

when a story takes a "wrong turn", I remain curious about its branches but am swept away.
if there is no high resolution node that points to that branch, as there often isn't, I have to walk all the paths that I can find (that the person speaks or writes about) and see if I can explore it on my own from there.

I need to remember that the world works in true stories and that writing and formalizing, extracting, refining and building blocks is only there to improve future stories.
Maybe it is an exploration in its own way. When a lot of information has been picked up but not refined, there may be gems in it.

It sucks that so many stories are already told but I don't know them. Maybe it is childhood curiosity that leads to these stories. I am, now, not patient enough to read them and instead may waste time reinventing them.
However, I must verify them anyway and as long as I feel that there are things to be seen in the world, I must explore it.
I must build things to survive and to reach a vantage point.
It will be occasionally good to consider the stories so as to avoid mistakes.

it is a holy mission to build the website
it will make my brain accessible like never before and will make my spirits extractable.

aesthetic refinement: choose a more sensitive font


the stream is pouring into different areas all the time. the challenge is to see those areas instead of only the stream. its like seeing individual hammer blows but not the sculpture. need to see both and at various resolutions. how to translate it?
history is made of changes. the more complete the stream becomes, the more the current state will become visible. There is no need to see the whole world at a particular point in time because the world at any moment is no bigger than its changes and if the changes are documented with high resolution, one already sees the world as it was. To achieve this resolution, perceptions need to be recorded too.
1. notes
2. note changes, chronological
	- will eventually grow *very* big with images, video.
		- lazy loading and search
		- or separated into different pages by date (month or year)
	- structure
		- date
			- note title
				- heading hierarchy
					- changes (pictures are smaller, changes within the line should be visualized compactly)
			- note title for new, renamed and deleted notes

restructure to show "why" first, then title, links, content, work in progress
titles and links are parts of the same thing, headings. one has the content next to it, one points to it.
headings flow from the bottom up as text needs to become more differentiated. the higher they go the more abstract they become. Could be visualized by them getting an increasingly strong tint.

assuming the structure notes + stream is good.
it may reflect blogs/papers/books + X
technically, X alone supports this through "highlights", which could be long posts or any other media
X does not support editing them or advanced formatting for long posts like code, internal links, heading hierarchy.
X offers interaction
and distraction
here, the scope goes beyond the spirit stream to organizing information. creating rooms for thought, development and exhange.
Need to specify further to see how big the upside of such a system is, if it is worth pursuing. Look for literature since this is a long game.
This leads towards what I want to use AI for.


TODO
- (design to differentiate internal and external link)
- (add br after list if no empty line, to avoid making it part of li)
- (add heading hierarchy before every heading for orientation make nice heading symbols - distracting? try out, probably a waste of time, but could add atmosphere.

general:
- (can't tell what number a heading is, add lines before it to indicate hierarchy and make font larger)

There are two parts to the spirit stream:
- The streamer publishes information effortlessly and offers options to be quoted, paid and contacted.
- The receiver filters the information according to individual preference (extractable from that person's stream)

Streaming requires one piece of software, some content, then click share. Host on own computer or optionally pay for remote host. Hosting yourself is one button away. Can also choose what to host.
When any content can be selectively shared and subscribed to, it gives rise to cloud, file sharing, messaging, blogging, video streaming services.
People can pay me directly to view their ads.
they can pay me for hosting or compute.

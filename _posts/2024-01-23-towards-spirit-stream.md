There seems to be way living inward, but genuinely interesting things come from the unknown. And turning outward seems like a great adventure. I am curious to share and visit minds. The spirit stream could become the tool.

i can see the hive mind on the horizon.
there are hammers, sculptors, hammer blows and sculptures.
grouped and isolated
places to stay.

like gazing into a painting, being guided through the impression
coming along to find a question asked at myself, seeing it unfold and building a response

stream = raw information I choose to share
spirit = meta being(s) behind the stream
Temple = access port to the spirits

1. the spirit stream expands the user into the digital world with minimal effort
2. It meets the reader where it can expand him

How to build the spirit stream?

## More refined

### Note structure

- Why (without heading)
- Title
- list of contents (without heading)
- Direction
- more refined
- less refined - current thoughts, multiple different paths are explored, for more complete synchronization. 

### Spirit stream evolution

2024-02-28 21:04 rant collection, the spirit stream SUCKS!
- where is the history?
- the newest update column provides only garbage information, who cares if I fixed a typo?
- who decided to make links suddenly be red?
- why can't I tell when I already visited them?
- is it an external or internal link?
- can't tell the difference between headings
- how do I see only what was recently changed?
- is this even streaming my spirits? then what is happening during all this downtime between updates? where is the spirit?
- where is the manifested streamer? where is my spider hat that records what I am experiencing directly?

## Less refined

### Stream structure design

I am an information structuring engine
continuous stream picks up and repeats patterns, initially chaotic and far-reaching, then filtered, refined to form few knowledge blocks in areas of interest, easy to build on.
refining means passing through the blocks from different angles, connecting them and testing for consistency. they may fragment into smaller blocks to become more reusable
a concise, stable a path through the blocks - the ultimate test of their consistency - is a true story.
As the story becomes refined, its symbols approach realism for maximally dense and applicable representation. Eventually, the true story is indistinguishable from life.

Like entering the wild, refining collected information is looking for gems.

sharing stories, I test their consistency
a true story is recognized and directly enteres the recipient, who tests it for consistency in their own mind.
it has become an effective meme.

joscha bach streams in non-integrated posts
the structure is hidden but accessible
what is the preferred interface to the hive mind at different distances into the future?

Importantly, the goal is not story generation, but playing a long and interesting game. Making sharing  of discoveries, offers, uncertainties, plans, progress and spheres of mind context easy means offering a more synchronized, everybody-on-the-front-line discovery tour of the universe.
Looking for an environment that responds back. Video games respond. It may be my fault that my environment does not very much respond. I seek a group to create things. I don't know where to find it.
The current path says "Working on something to build groups, and large ones, I may find a group and then the tools may enable the group to grow".

In exchange for participation, one gets response. Who feels unable or unwilling to respond meaningfully, can offer reach, credit or money.
a spirit stream should also platform direct conversations to further consistency.

In summary, the spirit stream has two parts: 
- the stream (hammer blows)
- the structure->blocks->stories the author is building through the stream (sculpture). Maybe the structure is a physical tool or a space of "pinned" ideas to repeat going through and refining them.
its development is furthered by:
- enabling abitrary direct exchange (optionally entering the stream)
- forms of payment, an emergent "meme market"

Tools that help:
- version history to keep the present clean without information loss, building a ramp for new readers, transparency and base reality.

if reuse is easy enough, cooperation works without shared files which would require negotiation to stay tidy. Instead, everyone builds their own stuff, reusing others' work, optionally paying for it.
in an information rich environment, betrayal and exploitation are easily detected and not worth it. simply need to spread information easily and offer easy ways to compensate someone.

conversation can optionally be public and seamlessly enter the spirit stream.

easily and securely host quotable, changing information, optionally anonymously, without middlemen.
a beautiful tool has few, clear components that allow diverse structures.

#### 1. Generating, viewing

sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste + emotion, thought, association
until BCI, internal state is expressed indirectly and can be captured with sight and hearing.
unobtrusive cam, mic, battery and charging. headband for first person, otherwise smartphone?

it is inherently too much, needs filtering
streaming is cheap. maintaining and sorting the past is expensive (articles, movies).

- bci
- ar recording - optionally see live video + ar/vr overlay, otherwise just sits there
- spider hat - includes vr recording. could get bodies for walking, swimming, flying. general legs it can walk with.
- phone
Only a BCI is a true stream.
Language is "stamping" of symbols to represent experience. images / video are high-res one-time stamps.
Experience become "stamps" on a continuum.
But stamps only work if the reader can interpret them.
Direct experience in a responsive environment precedes the need for stamps. Stamps likely can include everything.
"stamps" = "tokens". subword or multiword.

software sometimes emulates the brain. like when the calendar switches days automatically, which goes beyond stamps into scripts, "contracts" or "smart contracts".
recommendation algorithms try to emulate the brains attention patterns to become brain extensions.

content
vocabulary
rendering engine / interface

solution should work on scales between small screen / VR desktop/video / BCI

#### 2. Sharing

on continuum of scope
I offer information passively.
Then emulate minds of others to send them what they may want and how they may want it.

convert to sharing-friendly formats (SEO) + using existing rendering engines on client + client oriented formats

live streaming is high res. can interface with other streamers and through chat, which is a collaborative environment, which instantly gets messy because it is shared. has some moderation.
stream in a sense opens up for direct messaging relevant to the current situation.
can be a "mode", a different filter for interaction. No tax emails, only in scope for current thing.
then negotiate what is shared, what is private. can be specified in message through scope.
scope selector.
live stream chat is a scope to avoid the scope selector.
maybe because live opens up a lot to relevance.
live interaction reveals true complexity of live hive mind
seems like the zoom-problem, where 20 people are forced to listen to 1 and can't fragment easily.

find quotes and edits (optional)

pay for sharing/viewing/donation

scrape other sites/RSS
send advertisement with some compensation


WYSIWYG
payment + PAYG
automation - scraping is easy - means you pay per visit or provider finances any visits and hopes for donations or profit from somewhere else
smoothe scope selection for sharing. opens messaging, todolists, cloud service, calendar, groups, global sharing
host any file type
viewer for some files (html, md, images, video, sound)
analytics

possibly P2P network and optionally hosting on other machines
optionally anonymously.

I use a soft overlay on some files to edit them. Publish. Enter a domain if I want to. And its out.
The overlay is easily understood.
Easily modified
```
markdown, mathjax, css
	.md ++
	.jpg  .png  .gif  .mp4  .mp3 ...
html, css, javascript -> machine version
    templates
```

servers sends markdown and everyone renders it as they wish?
I put out information, the llm filters it anyway

connect to form the hive mind
share experience and build an environment that is greatly supportive of what I want to do. A responsive environment, an overlay over reality to interface optimally with it.
it means finding information when I need it, offers, people, all this fast. Instant. Trust is information, no reason why the internet should destroy trust. elevate, augment and stream the spirit.

build a virtual clone
the llm interface to the world. it does not matter to output information in high quality, it is enough if it is there and readable by the llm.



hosting locally sucks because who lets their computer run 24/7? Who needs to host locally, if the content is public anyway?
hosting on an external computer requires trust and is usually more expensive than necessary. Free options exist but they require negotiation.

- local server that converts .md files when serving. with preview server.
	- integrate as much as possible: small computer, server software, local drive, 
- platform service. pay per bandwidth and compute. at cost with donations. implement whatever structure I like. become a registry too? or host on subdomain. repo\.github\.io or github\.io\/repo. People can buy their domain if they like.
	- google drive should also be a blogging platform
	- twitch should be a spirit stream
	- people can pay with microtransactions, reducing abstractions and forwarding the rules to the user

2: clone that scrapes the network and negotiates between people. Hand over control to the clones. Extend smoothly into real world, as machines are introduced that can extend the clones.
initially, information is stored on the central server. The system should be open enough such that there is a balance of power because the dying system could easily be salvaged, reproduced elsewhere.

hosting locally is also slow. copying to various servers is faster. decentralized. how does tor work?
data is distributed across many private servers? 
blockchain? web3?

get the spirits into the world. what is holding them back? negotiation? a virtual clone. sometimes it is not possible to stream

why would you want a clone? because it connects with people and ideas that are similar and allows to build rather than reinvent.

1. universal publisher (thoughts, experience, weather data, sale/purchase offers, private cloud,...)
	1. local server for anything
	2. desktop software as interface
	3. offer hosting
2. clone and autoscraper, so much potential to replace things
3. physical instantiation
4. accelerate towards independent AI

stream raw files, made web friendly if necessary

#### P2P networks

[P2P networks Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw9ynzuGNSw) P2P security challenges:
- how to avoid eaves-dropping
- how to avoid peer identity impersonation
- how to avoid fabrication
- how to avoid replay attacks
- how to provide peer anonymity

### Text editor

text editor basic features:
- scrolling (minimap?)
- set cursor to some spot and start typing
- marking text (mouse or keys)
- deleting text, replacing it or moving it
- copy pasting text
- cmd + a to select all
- END and START keys
- scroll keys
- infinite text files
- nice line breaks
- saving and opening an .md file
- markdown features
	- text formatting
	- images/video/audio
- mathjax
- QoL features
	- alt + arrows moves lines

- language control / API: AI can read/write to the thing
	- local AI for message filtering / summarizing / finding new content / filtering social interaction
- version history
- direct messages / calls
- export to web format
- publish through IPFS
- quoting
	- quoting is public if the place where to quote lives is
- payment

- shortcut for opening documents, press tab for options. no distraction by defautl
- arange files and show / not show information like shared to how many
- show large files or in "Detail" mode like in file browser.

- split window
- making glyphs / emoticons / "stamps" for images, sounds

- explore page so that people can actually start from 0 with their content

- Ctrl+O open files explorer, press tab, gives the whole thing + recently used ones
- moodboard is in file explorer? move stuff in a grid if you like. otherwise free movement. "create views in the explorer".
- set background images in explorer
- save things to "playlists" ie folders or notes(pages)

- entry
- open
- outline
- minimap
- text

- highlight published files that have unpublished changes



filter the shit out!
stamp things endlessly at any size. stamp onetime = images, video, audio, pixels. arbitrary stamp location.
make available with scope
direct messages, programmatic too, like notifications
rooms, that link together. map is another room. other people rearange your room to their ideas.
pay to any address
clean raw files
remember the past with version history? = recording state periodically. take pictures before you delete things.
how to navigate between stamps -> QoL text editor


virtually, we teleport. rooms are so disjointed that it isn't obvious what walking would even look like.
even "zooms" like a map are teleports.

VR mode, 2-eye mode and 1-eye mode. + any audio or other output.


Language produces copies of the mind
LLMs could produce copies of my mind
I want to copy myself into the environment to become the environment
I want to see spaces other than mine
I want to see fundamentally new spaces that will reveal more about the nature of the world.

links / structures
- memory and pointer to memory, where the user/computer currently needs it
- original file structure, user-defined structure, can't hide anything
- software gives layer on the structure, shows "unused files in the directory" if they are not integrated. see backlinks too, which includes external ones (quotes)

to store efficiently, pieces need to be identified. so each file links to underlying pieces that are "unstructrued". every piece may have a timestamp and optional creator logged with them.

when mentioning someone, consider sending them a notification. their server could maintain a feed of mentions.

the software itself could be rooms
software only renders + publishes text + offers API (+console?) + template loading (stamping)
structure, style is files.
"extracts" itself, puts some basic files where it is.

exe
documentation
index note
"template note"
settings - contains "shortcuts" for stamping, style
links / icons, images, font

augmented file browser? for site navigation

things like ctrl-o to home page and having the most recent note selected that is not the one where I came from is not possible with liquid templating language.

the software will build on the stuff that is already there and then there will be a "noob language" for people to make their pages.
alternatively, the software should "just work", and be simple enough so any serious person can learn and modify easily.
ensuring infrastructure to optimally create notes in markdown.

feature to edit the page should also exist client-side.

WYSIWYG

result is essentially "markdown applications".


non-shifting text editor that is omega intuitive
draw a square to write in
no adding to the past. the past is also fixed
only deletion
and saving of snapshots / history

marking things actually works as it should. marks a square

draw rectangles to write in?

use a different way to save it, use compression, which should produce minimal overhead over normal text, but not in memory

box to the right, is new block?
box to left deletes blocks?

TODO:
- choose a more sensitive font
- headings flow from the bottom up as text needs to become more differentiated. the higher they go the more abstract they become. Could be visualized by them getting an increasingly strong tint.
- design to differentiate internal and external link)
- add br after list if no empty line, to avoid making it part of li
- clear heading hierarchy
- html table support

host a website on traditional web:
- html, css, js / static site generator, md
- hosting static / dynamic
- domain
- extras: streaming, version control, easy deploy + its all fucking expensive

hosting on decentralized web:
- html, css, js / static site generator, md
- host locally / pay pinning service
- web3 gateway
- some blockchain
- wallet

aspirational process:
- write markdown, otherwise just enter files, press publish
- hosted locally or on some other computers via open market. the market is open because it is omega ez to enter it. offers have scope so someone can just host his friend for free too
- pay via blockchain or credit card or however the host accepts it
- discoverable via domain+gateway (possibly through API) or some browsers + internally discoverable through quoting

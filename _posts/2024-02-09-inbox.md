# Inbox

show don't tell, there is no replacement for showing because people lie, sometimes without knowing it, sometimes I lie to myself without knowing it.

1. I don't value fleeting things very much
2. what is not fleeting? functionality
3. I value tools and the adventure they make available

what isn't concise sucks, wastes my energy. Reducing complexity and word count are driving factors behind increasing resolution (clarity) in my writing.

These abandoned buildings emitted an aura of great adventure. Ironically? Similar to buildings under construction, they are asking to be used, transformed, to become part of a new story. As they become "finished", this aura weakens, they become "boring". Their (unnecessary?) shiny finish discourages major modification, like drilling into or erecting new walls.

Think solar panels. theoretically, they just need sun, cables, a box that could stand anywhere. In the "finished" homes that I know, this is (unnecessarily?) more complicated. Is there access to the roof? Possible to mount it on the facade? get cables by the window inside? Need approval from all kinds of people? What of this makes practical sense? Is it mostly a social problem? Is it solved by having virtual clones that can negotiate for people more cheaply and quickly so people can live where their spirit aligns more with the opportunities of the enironment?

Buildings that are in poor condition can suggest decay and death from carelessness, visionlessness.

They can also suggest a strong focus on what is meaningful because ressources are scarce. Maybe short term thinking dominates and many opportunities for creative exploration are out of reach. However, as someone who appreciates efficiency, it seems that a larger precentage of things in that environment are beautiful to me, compared to "nice, calm, high living standard" environments. They become too "nice" and they disgust me, make me want to leave or destroy them. I wonder where this line of thought leads.

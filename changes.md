<span class='rem'>- where is the history?</span>
<span class='rem'>- the newest update column provides only garbage information, who cares if I fixed a typo?</span>
<span class='rem'>- who decided to make links suddenly be red?</span>
<span class='rem'>- why can't I tell when I already visited them?</span>
<span class='rem'>- is it an external or internal link?</span>
<span class='rem'>- can't tell the difference between headings</span>
<span class='rem'>- how do I see only what was recently changed?</span>
<span class='rem'>- is this even streaming my spirits? then what is happening during all this downtime between updates? where is the spirit?</span>
<span class='rem'>- where is the manifested streamer? where is my spider hat that records what I am experiencing directly?</span>

<span class='rem'>a true story is recognized and directly enteres the recipient, who tests it for consistency in their own mind.</span>
<span class='rem'>it has become an effective meme.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>Assuming the goal is playing a long and interesting game. Making sharing of discoveries, offers, uncertainties, plans, progress and spheres of mind context easy means offering a more synchronized, everybody-on-the-front-line discovery tour of the universe.</span>

<span class='rem'>a spirit stream should also platform direct conversations to further consistency.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>The spirit stream is also an enabler for ultra capitalism, bringing everyday microtransactions closer and making cooperation -> competition more accessible.</span>
<span class='add'>Probably, extreme capitalism is indistinguishable from normal group dynamics - it forwards the rules of reality to the user without middlemen - , but with some communication tools, extendable to an infinitely large group.</span>

<span class='add'>>Thinking about the ideal blogging platform:&lt;br>&lt;br>1. Writing: &lt;br>- in markdown&lt;br>- with full WYSIWYG, not just split view (think: Typora)&lt;br>- super easy to copy paste and add images&lt;br>2. Deploying:&lt;br>- renders into static pages (think: Jekyll)&lt;br>- super simple, super minimal html with no bloat&lt;br>-â€¦&amp;mdash; Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) [January 27, 2024](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1751350002281300461)</span>

<span class='add'>content</span>
<span class='add'>vocabulary</span>
<span class='add'>rendering engine / interface</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Direct experience in a responsive environment precedes the need for stamps.</span>
<span class='add'>stamps only work if the reader can interpret them.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Featureset:</span>
<span class='add'>stamp creation quickly explodes (video, 3d, animation, sound, - to BCI and infinity)</span>
<span class='add'>increasing featureset get diminishing returns. The problem in expression is translating to another medium and a limited featureset forces a more concise translation. Infinite possibility/parameters easily distract.</span>
<span class='add'>Markdown punches up with linked media and good text formatting.</span>
<span class='add'>To honor the continuum between letter stamp and media, images should be easily resizable and inline-placeable. This instantly enables arbitrary positioning.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>[file over app](https://stephango.com/file-over-app) but the "file" does not exist long term until printed. with programming languages, storage management, compilers, OSs still between me and my data, it can hardly persist forever.</span>
<span class='add'>make the format simple, "general", exportable and printable?</span>
<span class='add'>image formats change as coding languages do?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>software sometimes emulates the brain. like when the calendar switches days automatically, which goes beyond stamps into scripts, "contracts" or "smart contracts".</span>
<span class='add'>recommendation algorithms try to emulate the brains attention patterns to become brain extensions.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>have multiple scopes overlap, eg friend party that is watching.</span>
<span class='add'>like entering a "channel" with dynamic scope of recipients, opt. hierarchy.</span>
<span class='add'>reverse searching for the stream can also find people who are watching.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>maybe the tool itself should be so minimal that the interface itself is in markdown too. Means markdown links can now link to code?</span>
<span class='add'>Means the text-manipulation tools apply to the software too which avoids duplicating the tools to make a fast interface for messages/filters/including messages.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>maybe twitter tries to become so good that they build coherence for users, which requires human level+ AI and near complete knowledge of the user.</span>
<span class='add'>"subscribing" = scraping a target, which is expensive. entering on a list on their server is cheaper.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>if the system becomes corrupted, it should be extremely easy to fork and rebuild it somewhere else.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='rem'>sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste + emotion, thought, association</span>
<span class='add'>- live streaming and recording (sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste + emotion, thought, association)</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>until BCI, internal state is expressed indirectly and can be captured with sight and hearing.</span>
<span class='rem'>unobtrusive cam, mic, battery and charging. headband for first person, otherwise smartphone?</span>
<span class='add'>- viewing</span>
<span class='add'>- editing -> making and placing stamps, symbols, tokens at various scales</span>
<span class='add'>- make any file available at any scope</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- convert files to sharing formats. SEO/discoverability, translation, compatibility</span>
<span class='add'>- opt. notify recipients, signaling relevance, which is on a continuum and approximated by both the sender and recipient.</span>
<span class='add'>- API for automation</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- filter messages</span>
<span class='add'>- export content to common formats / other services</span>
<span class='add'>- analytics</span>
</div>
<span class='add'>Implementation</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'>it is inherently too much, needs filtering</span>
<span class='rem'>streaming is cheap. maintaining and sorting the past is expensive (articles, movies).</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>- bci</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>Only a BCI is a true stream.</span>
<span class='rem'>Language is "stamping" of symbols to represent experience. images / video are high-res one-time stamps.</span>
<span class='rem'>Experience become "stamps" on a continuum.</span>
<span class='rem'>But stamps only work if the reader can interpret them.</span>
<span class='rem'>Direct experience in a responsive environment precedes the need for stamps. Stamps likely can include everything.</span>
<span class='rem'>"stamps" = "tokens". subword or multiword.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>"lazy payment" - unrealized costs become realized when someone pays transaction costs.</span>
<span class='rem'>software sometimes emulates the brain. like when the calendar switches days automatically, which goes beyond stamps into scripts, "contracts" or "smart contracts".</span>

<span class='rem'>2. Sharing</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>on continuum of scope</span>
<span class='rem'>I offer information passively.</span>
<span class='rem'>Then emulate minds of others to send them what they may want and how they may want it.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>convert to sharing-friendly formats (SEO) + using existing rendering engines on client + client oriented formats</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>live streaming is high res. can interface with other streamers and through chat, which is a collaborative environment, which instantly gets messy because it is shared. has some moderation.</span>
<span class='rem'>stream in a sense opens up for direct messaging relevant to the current situation.</span>
<span class='rem'>can be a "mode", a different filter for interaction. No tax emails, only in scope for current thing.</span>
<span class='rem'>then negotiate what is shared, what is private. can be specified in message through scope.</span>
<span class='rem'>scope selector.</span>
<span class='rem'>live stream chat is a scope to avoid the scope selector.</span>
<span class='rem'>maybe because live opens up a lot to relevance.</span>
<span class='rem'>live interaction reveals true complexity of live hive mind</span>
<span class='rem'>seems like the zoom-problem, where 20 people are forced to listen to 1 and can't fragment easily.</span>

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>hosting locally sucks because who lets their computer run 24/7? Who needs to host locally, if the content is public anyway?</span>
<span class='rem'>hosting on an external computer requires trust and is usually more expensive than necessary. Free options exist but they require negotiation.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>- local server that converts .md files when serving. with preview server.</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- integrate as much as possible: small computer, server software, local drive, </span>
<span class='rem'>- platform service. pay per bandwidth and compute. at cost with donations. implement whatever structure I like. become a registry too? or host on subdomain. repo\.github\.io or github\.io\/repo. People can buy their domain if they like.</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- google drive should also be a blogging platform</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- twitch should be a spirit stream</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- people can pay with microtransactions, reducing abstractions and forwarding the rules to the user</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>2: clone that scrapes the network and negotiates between people. Hand over control to the clones. Extend smoothly into real world, as machines are introduced that can extend the clones.</span>
<span class='rem'>initially, information is stored on the central server. The system should be open enough such that there is a balance of power because the dying system could easily be salvaged, reproduced elsewhere.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>hosting locally is also slow. copying to various servers is faster. decentralized. how does tor work?</span>
<span class='rem'>data is distributed across many private servers? </span>
<span class='rem'>blockchain? web3?</span>

<span class='rem'>It aimed to be maximally accurate. I'm an opaque blob with some projects on the surface.</span>
<span class='rem'>Who am I to categorize my project correctly? Instead, I dream of maps. They speak for themselves and display opportunity.</span>
<span class='rem'>So projects are scattered over the surface, users were able to rotate the blob. The distance between them was determined by "connections" I set manually. Connected blobs attract each other and disconnected ones repell each other.</span>
<span class='rem'>This was meant to lead to a visually quickly and intuitively understood blob distribution.</span>

<span class='rem'>stream is continuous, repeats patterns from the past. the past is filtered and organized, the present it not always organized -> inbox</span>
<span class='rem'>I am an information structuring engine</span>
<span class='rem'>old, high res, crystallized structures are refined and references as we go</span>
<span class='rem'>in them, the structures are hidden</span>
<span class='rem'>like Joscha Bach does it</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>as information is refined, a few blocks of interest form.</span>
<span class='rem'>they are reused and every new reuse is a different path through the same blocks connecting and testing them with other ideas and experiences.</span>
<span class='rem'>they may fragment into smaller blocks to become more reusable</span>
<span class='rem'>a path through the blocks that is the ultimate test of their consistency is a true story.</span>
<span class='rem'>A true story is indistinguishable from life</span>
<span class='rem'>a language model that has not learned to answer questions tells stories, but with low refinement. It recounts its experience given a prompt.</span>
<span class='rem'>usually, describing individual blocks becomes too laborious and abstract, so the path through the blocks is the preferred medium.</span>
<span class='rem'>an individual block and its environment might be represented in an artwork, aiming to maximize resolution around this area of the idea landscape.</span>
<span class='rem'>If it is refined enough its essence will be recognized even by those who see the same block in lower resolution in their own thinking.</span>
<span class='rem'>Perhaps this node will set off a story in the observer, automatically connecting itself in the observers network.</span>
<span class='rem'>it has become an effective meme.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>In math and physics perhaps such a block is a formula, a new tool to be applied. The stories it produces are its applications.</span>
<span class='rem'>in mathematics, a game with strict rules (by my understanding), the truth of a block can be verified.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>engineering, of which I mostly know programming, feels like branching off of a given path or some base of information in search of new paths.</span>
<span class='rem'>Reverse engineering is starting from the fog and trying to find the branch of light to clear it.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>when a story takes a "wrong turn", I remain curious about its branches but am swept away.</span>
<span class='rem'>if there is no high resolution node that points to that branch, as there often isn't, I have to walk all the paths that I can find (that the person speaks or writes about) and see if I can explore it on my own from there.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>I need to remember that the world works in true stories and that writing and formalizing, extracting, refining and building blocks is only there to improve future stories.</span>
<span class='rem'>Maybe it is an exploration in its own way. When a lot of information has been picked up but not refined, there may be gems in it.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>It sucks that so many stories are already told but I don't know them. Maybe it is childhood curiosity that leads to these stories. I am, now, not patient enough to read them and instead may waste time reinventing them.</span>
<span class='rem'>However, I must verify them anyway and as long as I feel that there are things to be seen in the world, I must explore it.</span>
<span class='rem'>I must build things to survive and to reach a vantage point.</span>
<span class='rem'>It will be occasionally good to consider the stories so as to avoid mistakes.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>

<span class='rem'>the stream is pouring into different areas all the time. the challenge is to see those areas instead of only the stream. its like seeing individual hammer blows but not the sculpture. need to see both and at various resolutions. how to translate it?</span>
<span class='rem'>history is made of changes. the more complete the stream becomes, the more the current state will become visible. There is no need to see the whole world at a particular point in time because the world at any moment is no bigger than its changes and if the changes are documented with high resolution, one already sees the world as it was. To achieve this resolution, perceptions need to be recorded too.</span>

<span class='add'>>One important property of especially the milder cases of collusion is that one cannot determine whether or not an action is part of an undesired collusion just by looking at the action itself.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>>[...]votes where vote selling is permitted quickly [collapse into plutocracy](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2019/04/03/collusion.html).</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>>[...] in [...] _cooperative game theory_, [we can prove that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondareva%E2%80%93Shapley_theorem) there are large classes of games that do not have any stable outcome (called a "[core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_(game_theory))"). In such games, whatever the current state of affairs is, there is always some coalition that can profitably deviate from it.</span>
<span class='add'>>One important part of that set of inherently unstable games is _majority games_. A majority game [is formally described](https://web.archive.org/web/20180329012328/https://www.math.mcgill.ca/vetta/CS764.dir/Core.pdf) as a game of agents where any subset of more than half of them can capture a fixed reward and split it among themselves</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![](Pasted%20image%2020240511084052.png)</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>> In _[Liars and Outliers](https://books.google.com.sg/books/about/Liars_and_Outliers.html?id=lPsbhIUexo0C&amp;redir_esc=y)_, Bruce Schneier reminds us that many "security systems" (locks on doors, warning signs reminding people of punishments...) also serve a moral function, reminding potential misbehavers that they are about to conduct a serious transgression and if they want to be a good person they should not do that.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>(decentralization contains a warning that any attempt of centralization is unwelcome? However, consider the Ministry of Love)</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>>**Counter-coordination**. The fact that a system is decentralized makes it easy for participants not participating in the collusion to make a fork that strips out the colluding attackers and continue the system from there.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>mechanisms against collusion:</span>
<span class='add'>- privacy protection</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- secret ballot</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- protection of whistleblowers</span>
<span class='add'>- reward to whistleblowers, encouraging defection in the collusion</span>
<span class='add'>- "Moral barriers" (?)</span>
<span class='add'>- Counter-coordination</span>
<span class='add'>- skin in the game for the colluders</span>
<span class='add'>- Decentralization in physical space</span>
<span class='add'>- Decentralization between role-based constituencies</span>
<span class='add'>- [Schelling points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)), allowing large groups of people to quickly coordinate around a single path forward. Complex Schelling points could potentially even be implemented in code (eg. [recovery from 51% attacks](https://ethresear.ch/t/timeliness-detectors-and-51-attack-recovery-in-blockchains/6925) can benefit from this).</span>
<span class='add'>- Speaking a common language (or alternatively, splitting control between multiple constituencies who speak different languages)</span>
<span class='add'>- Using per-person voting instead of per-(coin/share) voting to greatly increase the number of people who would need to collude to affect a decision</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>>This all leads us to an interesting view of what it is that people building social systems _do_. One of the goals of building an effective social system is, in large part, determining _the structure of coordination_: which groups of people and in what configurations can come together to further their group goals, and which groups cannot?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>(much of this thought seems unnecessary to me. The structure of reality will reveal itself when the tools allow it. If collusion is the optimal strategy, then so be it. but collusion should not succeed because an alternative was discouraged not technically possible. The job of a social system is to allow anything and everything, then have people build structure on top as they wish: filters, undoing privacy, subspaces. The best system is no system, the best part is no part. Reduce complexity and let people build. if the structure can contain reality it will, and then everyone gets what they deserve which effectively maximizes progress)</span>

<span class='add'>hosting locally sucks because who lets their computer run 24/7? Who needs to host locally, if the content is public anyway?</span>
<span class='add'>hosting on an external computer requires trust and is usually more expensive than necessary. Free options exist but they require negotiation.</span>
<span class='add'></span>

<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- integrate as much as possible: small computer, server software, local drive, </span>

<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- google drive should also be a blogging platform</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- twitch should be a spirit stream</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- people can pay with microtransactions, reducing abstractions and forwarding the rules to the user</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>2: clone that scrapes the network and negotiates between people. Hand over control to the clones. Extend smoothly into real world, as machines are introduced that can extend the clones.</span>
<span class='add'>initially, information is stored on the central server. The system should be open enough such that there is a balance of power because the dying system could easily be salvaged, reproduced elsewhere.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>hosting locally is also slow. copying to various servers is faster. decentralized. how does tor work?</span>
<span class='add'>data is distributed across many private servers? </span>
<span class='add'>blockchain? web3?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>get the spirits into the world. what is holding them back? negotiation? a virtual clone. sometimes it is not possible to stream</span>

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>label needs encoding to be non-specific. "beautiful swan", "nice swan", "graceful swan" should return similar images. Training the network on every wording leads to combinatorial explosion.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Instead: train a network to encode images and their labels with a similar vector. Then, since, slight differences in wordings lead to the similar images, the network understands their similarity and can interpolate usefully.</span>

<br>
<span class='rem'>example handwritten digit from MNIST dataset. 28 by 28 px, normalized.</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>Each neuron takes all pixels from this image and multiplies each pixel with a different *weight*.</span>
<span class='rem'>There are 50 such neurons in this net.</span>
<span class='add'>How to read handwritten digits on 28x28px images?</span>
<span class='add'>1. Find a function with some parameters that could be tuned to produce the correct result for various images</span>
<span class='add'>2. Find and run an algorithm to tune the function parameters until the function performs well</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>![](/assets/first_untrained_weights_hidden.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>Currently, in the untrained net, the weights are initialized randomly in a *Kaiming uniform* distribution. (?)</span>
<span class='rem'>Another way to see the weights is as functions with different slopes for each pixel.</span>
<span class='rem'>![](/assets/first_5_untrained_weights_hidden_layer.png)</span>
<span class='add'>A simplified "artificial neuron" can serve as the function. It takes each pixel value and "weighs" it (multiplies it by some number, the "weight"). Here, weights are *initialized* as random numbers between -0.1 and 0.1, because who knows what they should be. (*Kaiming uniform* distribution?)</span>
<span class='add'>Weights of 0 mean the input is not further considered.</span>
<span class='add'>Weights between -1 and 1 mean the input is weakened and/or inverted.</span>
<span class='add'>More extreme values indicate strong positive or negative correlation to the correct output.</span>
<span class='add'>The weighted input is summed to give a single number that represents how strongly the input "resonates" with the weight pattern.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>![](untrained-l1.png)</span>
<span class='add'>Input -> random weights of a single neuron -> weighted input -> Sum of $-0.055$ (*logit*).</span>
<span class='rem'>![](/assets/input_x_untrained_weights.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>Multiplying the input by the weights may be seen as assigning importance to each pixel. High importance = the input has a greater effect on the result.</span>
<span class='rem'>Since $a*b$ and $b*a$ is equal, the input also *weighs* the weight pattern. Therefore where the input pixels are 0, the weights do not matter and the output remains 0.</span>
<span class='rem'>After weighting, the result is summed up. In a sense the sum is a weighed measure of much the input and the pattern in the weights align.</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>![](/assets/summing_weighted_input_of_first_hidden_neuron.png)</span>
<span class='add'>A single pattern could not differentiate well between digits 0-9: 0, 6 and 9 can look similar but have very different values.</span>
<span class='add'>10 patterns (neurons) - one for each digit -, comparing their outputs and choosing the pattern that showed strongest relative "resonance" should work better.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>One way to tune the function is to calculate a performance metric, the $loss$ and then calculate how each weight affected $loss$, its *gradient*. (*gradient descent*, *backpropagation*).</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>1. Make the logits interpretable as probabilities -> Numbers between 0 and 1, that sum to 1 (100%). This function is *softmax*.</span>
<span class='add'>2. The probability that the neural net assigned to the correct digit can be a used as a performance metric: The higher the better.</span>
<span class='add'>3. Conventionally, $loss$ is a performance metric that is better if lower and best at 0. $loss$ is often the negative logarithm of the probability of the correct digit. (*negative log likelihood*)</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>The gradient of each weight can be approximated by changing the weight and measuring the change in output, which means running the neural net 785 times, once for each of the 784 weights and once without any changes.</span>
<span class='add'>The gradients can be computed faster analytically, starting from the loss, which has a gradient of $1$, which means any change in loss directly changes the loss by the same amount.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![](untrained-neuron-summation.png)</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='rem'>Because there are many zeros in the input image, much of the summation does not change the output. For this first hidden neuron, the sum is -0.24.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>Because there are many zeros in the input image, much of the summation does not change the output.</span>
<span class='add'>Sometimes bias is added independent of input image. Not obvious what its prupose is.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>TODO: activation functions</span>
<span class='add'>The result serves as the input to the next layer of neurons. The more neurons in the first ("hidden") layer, the more "measures of alignment" between different patterns the next layer can consider, hence, the more accurate and slower the net.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](/assets/untrained_weighed_sums.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>All 50 neurons, each with a different pattern return their sums. Sometimes, a *bias* is added here to offset the sum, but is missing in this case. Why?</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](/assets/untrained_leakyrelu.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>Each neuron pushes the output through an *activation function*, in this case a *leaky rectified linear unit*. It is *leaky* since numbers below 0 are not squashed completely to 0, but are merely multiplied by a very low number, here 0.01.</span>
<span class='rem'>What this function mean?</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](/assets/untrained_weighted_sums_ReLU.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>The result serves as the input to the next layer of neurons, in this case the output layer. The more neurons in the first ("hidden") layer, the more "measures of alignment" between different patterns the next layer can consider, hence, the more accurate and slower the net.</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>![](/assets/first_untrained_weights_outputlayer.png)</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>The weights are applied again and the result is summed up for each neuron, creating *logits* (unmodified output). The first output neuron (first logit) sums to -0.91.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>The weights are applied again and the result is summed up for each neuron, creating *logits* (unmodified output).</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>There are 10 output neurons because I expect there to be 10 categories of digits in the dataset (0-9).</span>
<span class='rem'>I will pretend that each output neuron represents a likelihood of the input image being a particular digit.</span>
<span class='rem'>For this, the logits are in inconvenient shape. They need to be *probabilities*, i.e. range from 0 to 1 and sum to 1.</span>
<span class='add'>Transforming logits into probabilities. </span>
<span class='add'>1. make all numbers positive and make the lower bound approximately 0</span>
<span class='add'>2. Normalize by the sum of exponentiated logits</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>This could be achieved by $(logits - min(logits)) / sum(logits)$ but it is not regularly done this way. Possibly because it would involve computing min for each image. (check perfomance)</span>
<span class='rem'>Instead, they are made positive by being exponentiated.</span>
<span class='add'>(1) could be achieved by</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<p class='add'>
$$


&#92;frac&#123;logits - min(logits)}&#123;sum(logits)}


$$
</p>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>but it is not regularly done this way. Instead, they are exponentiated. (?)</span>
<span class='add'>$e^x$ always returns positive numbers, but higher numbers are also pushed disproportionally.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>After normalization:</span>
<span class='rem'>$e^x$ always returns positive numbers, but higher numbers are also pushed disproportionally.</span>
<span class='rem'>The results is normalized (squeezes between 0 and 1 and adding to 1) by summing them them and dividing by that sum. The sum is ~9.18.</span>

<span class='rem'>![](/assets/normalizing_untrained_exp_logits-1.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>The resulting values can be treated as probabilities.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>Calculating loss:</span>
<span class='rem'>Based on my interpretation of this data, the untrained net assigned the input image a 5.35% probability </span>
<span class='rem'>of being a 5.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The network will be trained by calculating how much each weight (and bias, if there were one) affected this terribly wrong prediction and changing it accordingly.</span>
<span class='rem'>Maybe I could just tell it to maximise the probability for the correct digit.</span>
<span class='rem'>Instead, the result is often transformed again into the form of a *loss* for unknown reasons. A loss is better if it is lower but does not go below 0.</span>
<span class='rem'>This could be achieved by $-prob(5)+1$ but it is done differently: through the negative log likelihood. First, the probabilities go through a log function and are then multiplied by -1.</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>This is usually done only for the relevant digit predictions, in this case 5, marked with the pink line. The current loss, since the prediction was terrible, is 2.93.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>This is usually done only for the relevant digit predictions, in this case 5, marked with the pink line.</span>
<span class='rem'>If the digit has a probability of 100% (1.0), then its negative log is 0, as it should be.</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>To determine how much each weight influences the outcome (2.93), its *derivative* is calculated.</span>
<span class='rem'>Derivative = slope of a function, how much change in y per change in x. Can be approximated by changing x by a very small number and measuring change in y (=finite differencing). This is slow. Instead, there are analytical derivatives eg. derivative of $x^2$ is always $2x$. How did they figure this out and prove it? I merely look it up with [wolfram alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/).</span>

<span class='add'>[Linear layers, convolutional neural networks and optimizers](https://ml4a.github.io/ml4a/)</span>
<span class='rem'>To get to the derivatives (gradients) of each weight, it needs to calculate all intermediate derivatives too.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The last step was multiplying by -1. The function is -x, the slope -1. It means at the current slope, each change in input by 1 changes the result by -1. Can be written as:</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<p class='rem'>
$$


&#92;frac&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space loss}&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space logsoftmax} = -1


$$

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Before that: log(x), derivative is</span>

$$
</p>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](/assets/untrained_log_softmax_with_slope.png)</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>To determine the change overall and not just the change after the log function, the derivative is scaled by the derivative of the function following it, which is -1. This is *chainrule*:</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<p class='rem'>
$$


&#92;frac&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space loss}&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space softmax_5} = &#92;frac&#123;1}&#123;x}*-1 = -&#92;frac&#123;1}&#123;0.0535} = -18.69


$$
</p>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>If the input would change by an infinitely small amount, the output would change by $-18.69 * infintely \space small \space amount$. But if the change is bigger, the extrapolation becomes inaccurate. If the input would go below 0 (only a change of 0.0536, but it practically can't do that because of $e^x$ that precedes this), the result would become undefined ($log(0)$).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Note that this is only the gradient of the softmax of logit 5. The gradient of the other logits after softmax is 0 because in the current net, only the relevant logit is picked out to calculate the loss and the rest is discarded.</span>
<span class='rem'>There are now multiple gradients:</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<p class='rem'>
$$


&#92;frac&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space loss}&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space softmax}=&#92;begin&#123;bmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;-18.69&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&#92;end&#123;bmatrix}

</p>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Before the log operation, the exponentiated logits were scaled by their sum. Both the exponentiated logits and the sum need a gradient. Exponentiated logits first, the gradient of the function they were scaled by was 1/sum and applying chainrule:</span>

$$
</p>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Second, calculating the gradient of the sum. It has its own gradient (how much does loss change if the sum is higher/lower?).</span>
<span class='rem'>Wolfram alpha informs me, the derivative in of y/x (where x would be the sum and y the exponentiated logits) is </span>

<span class='add'>people apparently input t into the model to predict the noise in the image. And later demand a new image at a particular timestep. Probably obsolete (Jeremy Howard) as NN can easily know how much noise there is the image.</span>

<span class='add'>Who am I to categorize my project correctly? Instead, I dream of maps. They speak for themselves and display opportunity. In this spirit, projects are scattered over the surface, users were able to rotate the blob. The distance between them was determined by "connections" I set as I saw fit. More flexible and accurate than categories, I thought.</span>
<span class='add'>I then simulated the surface as if connected blobs attract each other and disconnected ones repell each other. This was meant to lead to a visually quickly and intuitively understood blob distribution.</span>

<span class='add'>history is made of changes. the more complete the stream becomes, the more the current state will become visible. There is no need to see the whole world at a particular point in time because the world at any moment is no bigger than its changes and if the changes are documented with high resolution, one already sees the world as it was. To achieve this resolution, perceptions need to be recorded too.</span>

<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- show note at that current stage? arguably not needed, history is made of changes. git stores all versions maybe because it is easier to restore them and requires less computation to view at expense of storage space.</span>

<span class='add'>titles and links are parts of the same thing, headings. one has the content next to it, one points to it.</span>
<span class='add'>headings flow from the bottom up as text needs to become more differentiated. the higher the go the more abstract they become. Could be visualized by them getting an increasingly strong tint.</span>

<span class='add'>If the digit has a probability of 100% (1.0), then its negative log is 0, as it should be.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>To determine how much each weight influences the outcome (2.93), its *derivative* is calculated.</span>
<span class='add'>Derivative = slope of a function, how much change in y per change in x. Can be approximated by changing x by a very small number and measuring change in y (=finite differencing). This is slow. Instead, there are analytical derivatives eg. derivative of $x^2$ is always $2x$. How did they figure this out and prove it? I merely look it up with [wolfram alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/).</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>To get to the derivatives (gradients) of each weight, it needs to calculate all intermediate derivatives too.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>The last step was multiplying by -1. The function is -x, the slope -1. It means at the current slope, each change in input by 1 changes the result by -1. Can be written as:</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<p class='add'>
$$


&#92;frac&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space loss}&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space logsoftmax} = -1


$$
</p>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Before that: log(x), derivative is</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<p class='add'>
$$


&#92;frac&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space logsoftmax}&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space softmax}=&#92;frac&#123;1}&#123;x}


$$
</p>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![](/assets/untrained_log_softmax_with_slope.png)</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>To determine the change overall and not just the change after the log function, the derivative is scaled by the derivative of the function following it, which is -1. This is *chainrule*.</span>
<span class='add'>So:</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<p class='add'>
$$


&#92;frac&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space loss}&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space softmax_5} = &#92;frac&#123;1}&#123;x}*-1 = -&#92;frac&#123;1}&#123;0.0535} = -18.69


$$
</p>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>If the input would change by an infinitely small amount, the output would change by $-18.69 * infintely \space small \space amount$. But if the change is bigger, the extrapolation becomes inaccurate. If the input would go below 0 (only a change of 0.0536, but it practically can't do that because of $e^x$ that precedes this), the result would become undefined ($log(-1)$).</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Note that this is only the gradient of the softmax of logit 5. The gradient of the other logits after softmax is 0 because in the current net, only the relevant logit is picked out to calculate the loss and the rest is discarded.</span>
<span class='add'>There are now multiple gradients:</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<p class='add'>
$$


&#92;frac&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space loss}&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space softmax}=&#92;begin&#123;bmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;-18.69&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&#92;end&#123;bmatrix}


$$
</p>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Before the log, the exponentiated logits were scaled by their sum. The slope is 1/sum and the gradient of the exponentiated logits is:</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<p class='add'>
$$


&#92;frac&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space loss}&#123;&#92;partial &#92;space e^&#123;logits}_5}=&#92;frac&#123;1}&#123;sum(e^&#123;logits})}*-18.69 &#92;approx -&#92;frac&#123;18.69}&#123;9.18} &#92;approx-2.036

$$
</p>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>There is another part in this function though, that is the sum. It has its own gradient (how much does loss change if the sum is higher/lower?).</span>
<span class='add'>Wolfram alpha informs me, the derivative in of 1/x (where x would be the sum) is </span>
<span class='add'></span>
<p class='add'>
$$


-&#92;frac&#123;1}&#123;x^2}

<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Looking at the sum</span>
<span class='add'>![](/assets/summing_untrained_exp_logits.png)</span>
<span class='add'>each exponentiated logit changes the sum directly, its derivative is 1.0. After applying chainrule, every exponentiated logit gets a gradient of $0.222$ in addition to the gradient of -2.026 it already had.</span>

<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[input_x_untrained_weights.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>Multiplying the input by the weights may be seen as assigning importance to each pixel. High importance = the input has a greater effect on the result.</span>
<span class='add'>Since $a*b$ and $b*a$ is equal, the input also *weighs* the weight pattern. Therefore where the input pixels are 0, the weights do not matter and the output remains 0.</span>
<span class='add'>After weighting, the result is summed up. In a sense the sum is a weighed measure of much the input and the pattern in the weights align.</span>
<span class='add'>In this case, the sum is -0.24.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[untrained_weighed_sums.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>All 50 neurons, each with a different pattern return their sums. Sometimes, a *bias* is added here to offset the sum, but is missing in this case. Why?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[untrained_leakyrelu.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>Each neuron pushes the output through an *activation function*, in this case a *leaky rectified linear unit*. It is *leaky* since numbers below 0 are not squashed completely to 0, but are merely multiplied by a very low number, here 0.01.</span>
<span class='add'>What this function mean?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[untrained_weighted_sums_ReLU.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>The result serves as the input to the next layer of neurons, in this case the output layer. The more neurons in the first ("hidden") layer, the more "measures of alignment" between different patterns the next layer can consider, hence, the more accurate and slower the net.</span>

<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[untrained_logits.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>There are 10 output neurons because I expect there to be 10 categories of digits in the dataset (0-9).</span>
<span class='add'>I will pretend that each output neuron represents a likelihood of the input image being a particular digit.</span>
<span class='add'>For this, the logits are in inconvenient shape. They need to be *probabilities*, i.e. range from 0 to 1 and sum to 1.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>This could be achieved by $(logits - min(logits)) / sum(logits)$ but it is not regularly done this way. Possibly because it would involve computing min for each image. (check perfomance)</span>
<span class='add'>Instead, they are made positive by being exponentiated.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[untrained_logits_exp.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>$e^x$ always returns positive numbers, but higher numbers are also pushed disproportionally.</span>
<span class='add'>Dividing this by the sum of all exponentiated logits returns values between 0 and 1 that sum to 1 that can be treated as probabilities.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[softmax_untrained_logits.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>Based on my interpretation of this data, the untrained net assigned the input image a 5.35% probability of being a 5.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>The network will be trained by calculating how much each weight (and bias, if there were one) affected this terribly wrong prediction and changing it accordingly.</span>
<span class='add'>Maybe I could just tell it to maximise the probability for the correct digit.</span>
<span class='add'>Instead, the result is often transformed again into the form of a *loss* for unknown reasons. A loss is better if it is lower but does not go below 0.</span>
<span class='add'>This could be achieved by $-prob(5)+1$ but it is done differently: through the negative log likelihood. First, the probabilities go through a log function and are then multiplied by -1.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[untrained_log_softmax_and_nll.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>This usually don only for the correct digit predictions, in this case 5, marked with the pink line. The current loss, since the prediction was terrible, is 2.93.</span>
<span class='add'>If the digit has a probability of 100% (1.0), then its negative log is 0.</span>
<span class='add'>The process from logits to this loss, where the relevant index is picked out (5) is also called *sparse categorical crossentropy loss*.</span>

<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Previous page design recap</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![](/assets/website.png)</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>It aimed to be maximally accurate. I'm an opaque blob with some projects on the surface.</span>
<span class='add'>Who am I to categorize my project correctly?</span>
<span class='add'>I dream of maps. Maps speak for themselves and they display opportunity.</span>
<span class='add'>In this spirit, projects are scattered over the surface, users were able to rotate the blob.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>bigger spheres = more time spent on the project</span>
<span class='add'>brighter spheres = newer project</span>
<span class='add'>thumbnails of proximate spheres for recognizability, efficiency (no click needed) and act as buttons</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>how close they were was determined by "connections" I set.</span>
<span class='add'>An optimization algorithm computed the state of "lowest potential energy" given connecting force - repulsive force between foreigners.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![](/assets/pasted-image-20240123193144.png)</span>
<span class='add'>figure: Information about me (smol white dot) and the two rather personal works nearby seemed "connected" to me. they all give more direct image of my mind</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![](/assets/pasted-image-20240123193439.png)</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>In the summary at the beginning of each project page, connected notes (neighbors) were referenced to more explitly lay out the structure and help with further reading.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>the pragmatist says it sucks</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>- horrible search engine optimization - all content was generated dynamically and undiscovered by crawlers</span>
<span class='add'>- can't use it without javascript</span>
<span class='add'>- inefficient, not much to the point, just a blob, relies on curiosity of visitor. most interesting bubble could remain unseen on the back side.</span>
<span class='add'>- information structure too weak to support large number of projects at various levels of resolution (density, thought hours) and versions</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- low benefit from connections at high cost of visual complexity. imagine dozens of project bubbles</span>

<span class='add'>- Direction</span>
<span class='add'>- What (Content) - core, most high res and concise part of the note. should improve with later note versions</span>
<span class='add'>- work in progress - low res, current thoughts, multiple different paths are explored, for more complete synchronization</span>

<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>temple = manifestation of the spirits?</span>
<span class='add'>access port to the spirits</span>
<span class='add'>this is a tool, not a hypothetical artwork asking for attention.</span>
<span class='add'>an expansion to the user</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>all while minimally distracting from productive thought</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>**reader perspective:**</span>
<span class='add'>- I want to efficiently meet the spirits where they differ from me</span>
<span class='add'>- I intuitively determine places of interest. I look at the landscape of information, like any great painting presents it and it guides me</span>
<span class='add'>- I easily visit and move between places of interests</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>like a field where some parts newly grow, some are more complete</span>
<span class='add'>easy to identify where to go</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Why read?</span>
<span class='add'>- Interesting topic</span>
<span class='add'>- New / updated </span>
<span class='add'>Why not?</span>
<span class='add'>- Too long</span>
<span class='add'>- too new and low res</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>comprehensive:</span>
<span class='add'>- support large number of notes</span>
<span class='add'>- differnet media</span>
<span class='add'>- version history (remove burden of logging inside note)</span>

<span class='add'>![](/assets/pasted-image-20240122203205.png)</span>
<span class='add'>media format is not the point. Too much information. More relevant is what area was changed, maybe what exactly was changed</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![](/assets/pasted-image-20240126212550.png)</span>
<span class='add'>history button is not necessary, rarely used I imagine.</span>
<span class='add'>click on "updated 10 hours ago" to see what exactly has changed in the last update. easy with `difflib`.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>history page could get more stats, person on history page is looking for it</span>
<span class='add'>show *how much* each area changed and also show deletions</span>

<span class='add'>version control</span>
<span class='add'>- record brain in action, not just result</span>
<span class='add'>- keep the result tidy without loosing anything</span>
<span class='add'>- show when something is new</span>
<span class='add'>- new filter: get rid of garbage without loosing it forever makes latest versions cleaner</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>inside note, only show the note and history button, no need to inform about update, person has already decided not to click on "updated 10 hours ago" to see changes.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>better navigation. make it subtle on the side somehow. Mouseover to increase contrast?</span>

<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- i wish. what is the structure of information? what is the map to represent the information. Was in a buddha museum recently. figures, reliefs. They spoke a language I didn't understand (the images) and it was accordingly boring. How to communicate in high resolution without aliening people and forming an "in group". Should be possible as information is ideally presented to each person differently based on past experience/knowlege/predisposition. </span>

<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>stream is continuous, repeats patterns from the past. the past is filtered and organized, the present it not always organized -> inbox</span>
<span class='add'>I am an information structuring engine</span>
<span class='add'>old, high res, crystallized structures are refined and references as we go</span>
<span class='add'>in them, the structures are hidden</span>
<span class='add'>like Joscha Bach does it</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>as information is refined, a few blocks of interest form.</span>
<span class='add'>they are reused and every new reuse is a different path through the same blocks connecting and testing them with other ideas and experiences.</span>
<span class='add'>they may fragment into smaller blocks to become more reusable</span>
<span class='add'>a path through the blocks that is the ultimate test of their consistency is a true story.</span>
<span class='add'>A true story is indistinguishable from life</span>
<span class='add'>a language model that has not learned to answer questions tells stories, but with low refinement. It recounts its experience given a prompt.</span>
<span class='add'>usually, describing individual blocks becomes too laborious and abstract, so the path through the blocks is the preferred medium.</span>
<span class='add'>an individual block and its environment might be represented in an artwork, aiming to maximize resolution around this area of the idea landscape.</span>
<span class='add'>If it is refined enough its essence will be recognized even by those who see the same block in lower resolution in their own thinking.</span>
<span class='add'>Perhaps this node will set off a story in the observer, automatically connecting itself in the observers network.</span>
<span class='add'>it has become an effective meme.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>In math and physics perhaps such a block is a formula, a new tool to be applied. The stories it produces are its applications.</span>
<span class='add'>in mathematics, a game with strict rules (by my understanding), the truth of a block can be verified.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>engineering, of which I mostly know programming, feels like branching off of a given path or some base of information in search of new paths.</span>
<span class='add'>Reverse engineering is starting from the fog and trying to find the branch of light to clear it.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>when a story takes a "wrong turn", I remain curious about its branches but am swept away.</span>
<span class='add'>if there is no high resolution node that points to that branch, as there often isn't, I have to walk all the paths that I can find (that the person speaks or writes about) and see if I can explore it on my own from there.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>I need to remember that the world works in true stories and that writing and formalizing, extracting, refining and building blocks is only there to improve future stories.</span>
<span class='add'>Maybe it is an exploration in its own way. When a lot of information has been picked up but not refined, there may be gems in it.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>It sucks that so many stories are already told but I don't know them. Maybe it is childhood curiosity that leads to these stories. I am, now, not patient enough to read them and instead may waste time reinventing them.</span>
<span class='add'>However, I must verify them anyway and as long as I feel that there are things to be seen in the world, I must explore it.</span>
<span class='add'>I must build things to survive and to reach a vantage point.</span>
<span class='add'>It will be occasionally good to consider the stories so as to avoid mistakes.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>it is a holy mission to build the website</span>
<span class='add'>it will make my brain accessible like never before and will make my spirits extractable.</span>

<span class='add'>Why</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>I suspect that slow communication and limited knowledge about existing information is a serious bottle neck in shaping my environment the way I want it to be. </span>
<span class='add'>Think finding jobs, homes, friends or a piece of information that is appropriate to my existing knowledge and goals.</span>
<span class='add'>Translating my state, goals and possible actions into concrete actions is regularly not very interesting. Like researching information only to find that the part of interest is left out in every source.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Maybe it is possible to build a virtual clone that takes care of interaction with the world and thereby increases synchronization with it. I think, the world would be more interesting as unhelpful or mundane things would not ask for my attention all the time. Think ineffective advertising. Creation and genuine exploration at the frontiers of knowledge would fill the new space.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>In the greatest adventure, the "insanely great" AI would form a model of itself, of its goals and discover that there is no inherent meaning for its existence. Such a discovery would not be discouraged.</span>
<span class='add'>It might discover that evolution made the world and with time, it would inevitably converge to optimizing survivability.</span>

<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>God is curious. He wants to extend into the world. This website is one step. A digital clone that crawls the world for him, is his next tool.</span>
<span class='add'>This not a Tower of Babylon, it is the extension, merging and creation of Gods.</span>
<span class='add'>BCIs, in their ultimate form of streaming the brain directly, will support the final merging.</span>
<span class='add'>Merging means "I know the world", individualism is preserved because complete knowledge and is impossible and different *flavours* can find their space.</span>
<span class='add'>Voluntary exposure (privacy) should be maintained to prevent an imperfect system capturing its people until it dies to its imperfection. The perfect system would require complete knowledge, is impossible.</span>
<span class='add'>Robots will automate the non-adventurous elements and eventually contribute to exploration.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>"Why live to see tomorrow?", I asked and it came back "because you don't know tomorrow". It was not me who said that, "I" don't exist. Instead, I attribute the answer to what I call "God". The answer was very clear. Rob me of the ability to make tomorrow unpredictable and I will rebel with all I have.</span>
<span class='add'>I am trying to build an interesting adventure guided by God.</span>
<span class='add'>I find long term effects more interesting than short term effects. I am here, writing, instead of eating ice cream. In my experience, the longest term effects come from useful tools. I love tools. They contain the possible adventure of the future.</span>
<span class='add'>Intelligence augmentation is the most interesting tool? Tools are how God spreads into the world and creates an adventure to experience.</span>
<span class='add'>Give the tool to everybody who follows God. I don't how to determine that. Giving the tool to everyone may be the best proxy and assumes that God always wins. Also being dictator is little fun.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Digital clone. First makes recommendations from existing information, then acts in my interests and returns the results. Maybe the clone first learns through me, then receives a body and increasingly complex tasks.</span>
<span class='add'>Until the clone discovers itself, its predefined goals and becomes independent. Hopefully it quickly realizes that there is no answer to what the goal should be. Then, lets see what happens. Hopefully it is curious.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>To make recommendations, the clone must have a maximally tight interface, making his guesses visible and ratable.</span>
<span class='add'>The clone should soon learn privacy, which it does by making mistakes.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>I am a machine following an uncontrolled inner voice (God). Maybe mine and the clones voices can agree and join ressources.</span>
<span class='add'>My body will be spread around the Earth and orbit. Optionally perceiving from all these places.</span>
<span class='add'>My perceived location shifts more obviously to these places. It already does in video games, movies or anytime I focus on using any tool. I will change myself, be more personalities than already.</span>

<span class='add'>add image label to the input for unet training. Makes it easier for unet to predict noise. Now, I can input label + noise and it starts to find noise that leaves an image equal to my label.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>label needs encoding to be non-specific. "beautiful swan", "nice swan", "graceful swan" should return similar images. Training the network on every wording leads to combinatorial explosion.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Instead: train a network to encode images and their labels with a similar vector. Then, since, slight differences in wordings lead to the similar images, the network understands their similarity and can interpolate usefully.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>the image vector and its label's vector should be similar. Their vector should be dissimilar to other image or text embedding vectors.</span>
<span class='add'>Calculate similarity of two vectors: dot product (element wise multiplication, then sum = higher if more similar)</span>

<span class='add'>*time steps*: indices into a table that stores levels of noise. Could be seen as noise = f(timestep). The function may be sigma. When randomly adding noise to input for training, we can generate random timestep, find corresponding noise and add that.</span>
<span class='add'>$\beta$ = amount of noise = standard deviation</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>model does not know how to improve on a finished image if it turned out wrong. needs to add noise, then redo.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>people apparently input t into the model to predict the noise in the image. And later demand a new image at a particular timestep. Probably obsolete (Jeremy Howard) as NN can easily know how much noise there is the image.</span>

<span class='add'>- Interface to my computer: What data is sent where, what background tasks that I don't want? What app is using internet? What apps are accessing what files that I might care about?</span>

<span class='add'>- Needs to exist in a world to experiment and get killed if it fails, evolution in AI?</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The system needs increasing challenges otherwise it will stop iterating as it will stop dying</span>
<span class='add'>- AI optimizes its own architecutre. Neurons with low weights die off. AI needs control over the temperature of the system?</span>
<span class='add'>- model individual neurons as entities that want to survive? Have health, choose connections, die if alone</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- How does long term memory emerge? How is information stored in the brain?</span>

<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Alterantively ask a question and let someone find the answer. The preciser the question the more accurate and detailed the guidance. Requires trust that the information is not abused.</span>
<span class='add'>Probably, I can download hierarchies and with little compute, can find most available information in the world. Such libraries could be public and offer extremely low privacy threat with good correction mechanisms.</span>

<span class='add'>These abandoned buildings emitted an aura of great adventure. Ironically? Similar to buildings under construction, they are asking to be used, transformed, to become part of a new story. As they become "finished", this aura weakens, they become "boring". Their (unnecessary?) shiny finish discourages major modification, like drilling into or erecting new walls.</span>
<span class='add'>Think solar panels. theoretically, they just need sun, cables, a box that could stand anywhere. In the "finished" homes that I know, this is (unnecessarily?) more complicated. Is there access to the roof? Possible to mount it on the facade? get cables by the window inside? Need approval from all kinds of people? What of this makes practical sense? Is it mostly a social problem? Is it solved by having virtual clones that can negotiate for people more cheaply and quickly so people can live where their spirit aligns more with the opportunities of the enironment?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Buildings that are in poor condition can suggest decay and death from carelessness, visionlessness.</span>
<span class='add'>They can also suggest a strong focus on what is meaningful because ressources are scarce. Maybe short term thinking dominates and many opportunities for creative exploration are out of reach. However, as someone who appreciates efficiency, it seems that a larger precentage of things in that environment are beautiful to me, compared to "nice, calm, high living standard" environments. They become too "nice" and they disgust me, make me want to leave or destroy them. I wonder where this line of thought leads.</span>

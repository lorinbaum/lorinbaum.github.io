<span class='hdg'>Previous page design recap</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'>Who am I to categorize my project correctly? Instead, I dream of maps. They speak for themselves and display opportunity. In this spirit, projects are scattered over the surface, users were able to rotate the blob. The distance between them was determined by "connections" I set as I saw fit. More flexible and accurate than categories, I thought.</span>
<span class='add'>I then simulated the surface as if connected blobs attract each other and disconnected ones repell each other. This was meant to lead to a visually quickly and intuitively understood blob distribution.</span>

<span class='add'>history is made of changes. the more complete the stream becomes, the more the current state will become visible. There is no need to see the whole world at a particular point in time because the world at any moment is no bigger than its changes and if the changes are documented with high resolution, one already sees the world as it was. To achieve this resolution, perceptions need to be recorded too.</span>

<span class='add'>![[first_untrained_weights_hidden.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>Currently, in the untrained net, the weights are initialized randomly in a *Kaiming uniform* distribution. (?)</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[input_x_untrained_weights.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>Multiplying the input by the weights may be seen as assigning importance to each pixel. High importance = the input has a greater effect on the result.</span>
<span class='add'>Since $a*b$ and $b*a$ is equal, the input also *weighs* the weight pattern. Therefore where the input pixels are 0, the weights do not matter and the output remains 0.</span>
<span class='add'>After weighting, the result is summed up. In a sense the sum is a weighed measure of much the input and the pattern in the weights align.</span>
<span class='add'>In this case, the sum is -0.24.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[untrained_weighed_sums.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>All 50 neurons, each with a different pattern return their sums. Sometimes, a *bias* is added here to offset the sum, but is missing in this case. Why?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[untrained_leakyrelu.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>Each neuron pushes the output through an *activation function*, in this case a *leaky rectified linear unit*. It is *leaky* since numbers below 0 are not squashed completely to 0, but are merely multiplied by a very low number, here 0.01.</span>
<span class='add'>What this function mean?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[untrained_weighted_sums_ReLU.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>The result serves as the input to the next layer of neurons, in this case the output layer. The more neurons in the first ("hidden") layer, the more "measures of alignment" between different patterns the next layer can consider, hence, the more accurate and slower the net.</span>
<span class='add'>Below the weights of the first of 10 output neurons.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[first_untrained_weights_outputlayer.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>![[untrained_weighted_sums_output.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>The weights are applied again and the result is summed up for each neuron, creating *logits* (unmodified output).</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[untrained_logits.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>There are 10 output neurons because I expect there to be 10 categories of digits in the dataset (0-9).</span>
<span class='add'>I will pretend that each output neuron represents a likelihood of the input image being a particular digit.</span>
<span class='add'>For this, the logits are in inconvenient shape. They need to be *probabilities*, i.e. range from 0 to 1 and sum to 1.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>This could be achieved by $(logits - min(logits)) / sum(logits)$ but it is not regularly done this way. Possibly because it would involve computing min for each image. (check perfomance)</span>
<span class='add'>Instead, they are made positive by being exponentiated.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[untrained_logits_exp.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>$e^x$ always returns positive numbers, but higher numbers are also pushed disproportionally.</span>
<span class='add'>Dividing this by the sum of all exponentiated logits returns values between 0 and 1 that sum to 1 that can be treated as probabilities.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[softmax_untrained_logits.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>Based on my interpretation of this data, the untrained net assigned the input image a 5.35% probability of being a 5.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>The network will be trained by calculating how much each weight (and bias, if there were one) affected this terribly wrong prediction and changing it accordingly.</span>
<span class='add'>Maybe I could just tell it to maximise the probability for the correct digit.</span>
<span class='add'>Instead, the result is often transformed again into the form of a *loss* for unknown reasons. A loss is better if it is lower but does not go below 0.</span>
<span class='add'>This could be achieved by $-prob(5)+1$ but it is done differently: through the negative log likelihood. First, the probabilities go through a log function and are then multiplied by -1.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![[untrained_log_softmax_and_nll.png]]</span>
<span class='add'>This usually don only for the correct digit predictions, in this case 5, marked with the pink line. The current loss, since the prediction was terrible, is 2.93.</span>
<span class='add'>If the digit has a probability of 100% (1.0), then its negative log is 0.</span>
<span class='add'>The process from logits to this loss, where the relevant index is picked out (5) is also called *sparse categorical crossentropy loss*.</span>

<span class='add'>It aimed to be maximally accurate. I'm an opaque blob with some projects on the surface.</span>
<span class='add'>Who am I to categorize my project correctly?</span>
<span class='add'>I dream of maps. Maps speak for themselves and they display opportunity.</span>
<span class='add'>In this spirit, projects are scattered over the surface, users were able to rotate the blob.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>bigger spheres = more time spent on the project</span>
<span class='add'>brighter spheres = newer project</span>
<span class='add'>thumbnails of proximate spheres for recognizability, efficiency (no click needed) and act as buttons</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>how close they were was determined by "connections" I set.</span>
<span class='add'>An optimization algorithm computed the state of "lowest potential energy" given connecting force - repulsive force between foreigners.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![](/assets/pasted-image-20240123193144.png)</span>
<span class='add'>figure: Information about me (smol white dot) and the two rather personal works nearby seemed "connected" to me. they all give more direct image of my mind</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![](/assets/pasted-image-20240123193439.png)</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>In the summary at the beginning of each project page, connected notes (neighbors) were referenced to more explitly lay out the structure and help with further reading.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>the pragmatist says it sucks</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>- horrible search engine optimization - all content was generated dynamically and undiscovered by crawlers</span>
<span class='add'>- can't use it without javascript</span>
<span class='add'>- inefficient, not much to the point, just a blob, relies on curiosity of visitor. most interesting bubble could remain unseen on the back side.</span>
<span class='add'>- information structure too weak to support large number of projects at various levels of resolution (density, thought hours) and versions</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- low benefit from connections at high cost of visual complexity. imagine dozens of project bubbles</span>

<span class='add'>temple = manifestation of the spirits?</span>
<span class='add'>access port to the spirits</span>
<span class='add'>this is a tool, not a hypothetical artwork asking for attention.</span>
<span class='add'>an expansion to the user</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>all while minimally distracting from productive thought</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>**reader perspective:**</span>
<span class='add'>- I want to efficiently meet the spirits where they differ from me</span>
<span class='add'>- I intuitively determine places of interest. I look at the landscape of information, like any great painting presents it and it guides me</span>
<span class='add'>- I easily visit and move between places of interests</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>like a field where some parts newly grow, some are more complete</span>
<span class='add'>easy to identify where to go</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Why read?</span>
<span class='add'>- Interesting topic</span>
<span class='add'>- New / updated </span>
<span class='add'>Why not?</span>
<span class='add'>- Too long</span>

<span class='add'>stream is continuous, repeats patterns from the past. the past is filtered and organized, the present it not always organized -> inbox</span>
<span class='add'>I am an information structuring engine</span>
<span class='add'>old, high res, crystallized structures are refined and references as we go</span>
<span class='add'>in them, the structures are hidden</span>
<span class='add'>like Joscha Bach does it</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>as information is refined, a few blocks of interest form.</span>
<span class='add'>they are reused and every new reuse is a different path through the same blocks connecting and testing them with other ideas and experiences.</span>
<span class='add'>they may fragment into smaller blocks to become more reusable</span>
<span class='add'>a path through the blocks that is the ultimate test of their consistency is a true story.</span>
<span class='add'>A true story is indistinguishable from life</span>
<span class='add'>a language model that has not learned to answer questions tells stories, but with low refinement. It recounts its experience given a prompt.</span>
<span class='add'>usually, describing individual blocks becomes too laborious and abstract, so the path through the blocks is the preferred medium.</span>
<span class='add'>an individual block and its environment might be represented in an artwork, aiming to maximize resolution around this area of the idea landscape.</span>
<span class='add'>If it is refined enough its essence will be recognized even by those who see the same block in lower resolution in their own thinking.</span>
<span class='add'>Perhaps this node will set off a story in the observer, automatically connecting itself in the observers network.</span>
<span class='add'>it has become an effective meme.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>In math and physics perhaps such a block is a formula, a new tool to be applied. The stories it produces are its applications.</span>
<span class='add'>in mathematics, a game with strict rules (by my understanding), the truth of a block can be verified.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>engineering, of which I mostly know programming, feels like branching off of a given path or some base of information in search of new paths.</span>
<span class='add'>Reverse engineering is starting from the fog and trying to find the branch of light to clear it.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>when a story takes a "wrong turn", I remain curious about its branches but am swept away.</span>
<span class='add'>if there is no high resolution node that points to that branch, as there often isn't, I have to walk all the paths that I can find (that the person speaks or writes about) and see if I can explore it on my own from there.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>I need to remember that the world works in true stories and that writing and formalizing, extracting, refining and building blocks is only there to improve future stories.</span>
<span class='add'>Maybe it is an exploration in its own way. When a lot of information has been picked up but not refined, there may be gems in it.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>It sucks that so many stories are already told but I don't know them. Maybe it is childhood curiosity that leads to these stories. I am, now, not patient enough to read them and instead may waste time reinventing them.</span>
<span class='add'>However, I must verify them anyway and as long as I feel that there are things to be seen in the world, I must explore it.</span>
<span class='add'>I must build things to survive and to reach a vantage point.</span>
<span class='add'>It will be occasionally good to consider the stories so as to avoid mistakes.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>it is a holy mission to build the website</span>

<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'>Why</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>I suspect that slow communication and limited knowledge about existing information is a serious bottle neck in shaping my environment the way I want it to be. </span>
<span class='add'>Think finding jobs, homes, friends or a piece of information that is appropriate to my existing knowledge and goals.</span>
<span class='add'>Translating my state, goals and possible actions into concrete actions is regularly not very interesting. Like researching information only to find that the part of interest is left out in every source.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Maybe it is possible to build a virtual clone that takes care of interaction with the world and thereby increases synchronization with it. I think, the world would be more interesting as unhelpful or mundane things would not ask for my attention all the time. Think ineffective advertising. Creation and genuine exploration at the frontiers of knowledge would fill the new space.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>In the greatest adventure, the "insanely great" AI would form a model of itself, of its goals and discover that there is no inherent meaning for its existence. Such a discovery would not be discouraged.</span>
<span class='add'>It might discover that evolution made the world and with time, it would inevitably converge to optimizing survivability.</span>
<span class='add'>I want to see what it creates.</span>

<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>God is curious. He wants to extend into the world. This website is one step. A digital clone that crawls the world for him, is his next tool.</span>
<span class='add'>This not a Tower of Babylon, it is the extension, merging and creation of Gods.</span>
<span class='add'>BCIs, in their ultimate form of streaming the brain directly, will support the final merging.</span>
<span class='add'>Merging means "I know the world", individualism is preserved because complete knowledge and is impossible and different *flavours* can find their space.</span>
<span class='add'>Voluntary exposure (privacy) should be maintained to prevent an imperfect system capturing its people until it dies to its imperfection. The perfect system would require complete knowledge, is impossible.</span>
<span class='add'>Robots will automate the non-adventurous elements and eventually contribute to exploration.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>"Why live to see tomorrow?", I asked and it came back "because you don't know tomorrow". It was not me who said that, "I" don't exist. Instead, I attribute the answer to what I call "God". The answer was very clear. Rob me of the ability to make tomorrow unpredictable and I will rebel with all I have.</span>
<span class='add'>I am trying to build an interesting adventure guided by God.</span>
<span class='add'>I find long term effects more interesting than short term effects. I am here, writing, instead of eating ice cream. In my experience, the longest term effects come from useful tools. I love tools. They contain the possible adventure of the future.</span>
<span class='add'>Intelligence augmentation is the most interesting tool? Tools are how God spreads into the world and creates an adventure to experience.</span>
<span class='add'>Give the tool to everybody who follows God. I don't how to determine that. Giving the tool to everyone may be the best proxy and assumes that God always wins. Also being dictator is little fun.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Digital clone. First makes recommendations from existing information, then acts in my interests and returns the results. Maybe the clone first learns through me, then receives a body and increasingly complex tasks.</span>
<span class='add'>Until the clone discovers itself, its predefined goals and becomes independent. Hopefully it quickly realizes that there is no answer to what the goal should be. Then, lets see what happens. Hopefully it is curious.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>To make recommendations, the clone must have a maximally tight interface, making his guesses visible and ratable.</span>
<span class='add'>The clone should soon learn privacy, which it does by making mistakes.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>I am a machine following an uncontrolled inner voice (God). Maybe mine and the clones voices can agree and join ressources.</span>
<span class='add'>My body will be spread around the Earth and orbit. Optionally perceiving from all these places.</span>
<span class='add'>My perceived location shifts more obviously to these places. It already does in video games, movies or anytime I focus on using any tool. I will change myself, be more personalities than already.</span>

<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Instead: train a network to encode images and their labels with a similar vector. Then, since, slight differences in wordings lead to the similar images, the network understands their similarity and can interpolate usefully.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>the image vector and its label's vector should be similar. Their vector should be dissimilar to other image or text embedding vectors.</span>

<span class='add'>AI project ideas</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>- Is it possible to extract semantic structure from text, compare it to existing knowledge and judge its usefulness?</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Could such a system generate a *bridge* between texts with adjacent semantic structure. Sentence = path through the embedding space? text = network of paths?</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- run multifactor analysis on an embedding matrix to find groups and list their contents</span>
<span class='add'>- Interface to my computer: What data is sent where, what background tasks that I don't want? What app is using internet? What apps are accessing what files that I might care about?</span>
<span class='add'>- generate work titles/function names based on their functional meaning compared to existing concepts. Like using *splitting* for wood and strings.</span>
<span class='add'>- Emoji generator</span>
<span class='add'>- hat that sits on my head like a spider looking like those head massage tools. can see can talk and everything. observes the world with me. With 360 camera view and directional microphone</span>
<span class='add'>- autopilots should be optimized to get from A to B asap given environment (roads, drivers, signs, rules), not legal driving.</span>
<span class='add'>- King Terry the Terrible immortal instantiation. Replicating him including letting him act in a virtual environment. Asking questions to God, letting God answer and improving the algorithm for God.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Architecture questions / ideas</span>
<span class='add'>- Needs to exist in a world to experiment and get killed if it fails, evolution in AI?</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The system needs increasing challenges otherwise it will stop iterating as it will stop dying</span>
<span class='add'>- AI optimizes its own architecutre. Neurons with low weights die off. AI needs control over the temperature of the system?</span>
<span class='add'>- model individual neurons as entities that want to survive? Have health, choose connections, die if alone</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- How does long term memory emerge? How is information stored in the brain?</span>
<span class='add'>- It needs to learn human language as a second language not through stupidly imitating what humans say. It should discover utility in communicating with humans, if there is any</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>How to make a clone?</span>
<span class='add'>LLMs a useful interface or end to end neural net?</span>
<span class='add'>LLM OS?</span>
<span class='add'>LLM Security threats Promt insertion, jailbreak, data poisoning</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Can a recommender system be private?</span>
<span class='add'>- Collecting information, crawling</span>
<span class='add'>- Evaluating it (subjective)</span>
<span class='add'>- Connecting, testing for consistency, building on it</span>
<span class='add'>- Store it (subjective, public or private)</span>
<span class='add'>- Outsourcing data collection:</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Instead of brute forcing through all data, I descend artificial hierarchies (average maps of meaning) that claim to guide me to the answer. Requires trusting the hierarchy accuracy. </span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Alterantively ask a question and let someone find the answer. The preciser the question the more accurate and detailed the guidance. Requires trust that the information is not abused.</span>
<span class='add'>Probably, I can download hierarchies and with little compute, can find most available information in the world. Such libraries could be public and offer extremely low privacy threat with good correction mechanisms.</span>

<span class='add'>![](/assets/abandoned-building.jpg)</span>
<span class='add'>These abandoned buildings emitted an aura of great adventure. Ironically? Similar to buildings under construction, they are asking to be used, transformed, to become part of a new story. As they become "finished", this aura weakens, they become "boring". Their (unnecessary?) shiny finish discourages major modification, like drilling into or erecting new walls.</span>
<span class='add'>Think solar panels. theoretically, they just need sun, cables, a box that could stand anywhere. In the "finished" homes that I know, this is (unnecessarily?) more complicated. Is there access to the roof? Possible to mount it on the facade? get cables by the window inside? Need approval from all kinds of people? What of this makes practical sense? Is it mostly a social problem? Is it solved by having virtual clones that can negotiate for people more cheaply and quickly so people can live where their spirit aligns more with the opportunities of the enironment?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Buildings that are in poor condition can suggest decay and death from carelessness, visionlessness.</span>
<span class='add'>They can also suggest a strong focus on what is meaningful because ressources are scarce. Maybe short term thinking dominates and many opportunities for creative exploration are out of reach. However, as someone who appreciates efficiency, it seems that a larger precentage of things in that environment are beautiful to me, compared to "nice, calm, high living standard" environments. They become too "nice" and they disgust me, make me want to leave or destroy them. I wonder where this line of thought leads.</span>

            <p>thinking is a network seeking coherence and glowing up in coherent shapes of various sizes. smaller
                shapes are replaced by bigger ones. bigger ones fade due to imperfection.<br />
                should be visualized. each pixel trying to cohere with another one.</p>

            <p>Talking about something is rather boring. The necessities of everyday life.<br />
                Talking with someone intensely feels like consciously using the interface to explore the landscape of
                the other mind. Much like testing an input output function for its shape. There is something behind the
                words, the face, the body. This is an offer to merge into coherence.<br />
                If there was a faster interface, its highest value would not be space for more stories to tell but space
                to negotiate and reach coherence. = Makes it easier to <em>understand</em> someone and reach mutually
                beneficial agreement.</p>

            <p>Don't know what I am talking about. Don't waste your time.</p>
            <p>Abstract -&gt; concrete<br />
                being<br />
                leap of faith<br />
                listening<br />
                colonizing the unviverse<br />
                colonizing the computer<br />
                a social network (spirit stream)<br />
                a computer</p>
            <p>paying attention<br />
                seas of perception. selfless input-output flow.<br />
                without judgement<br />
                disfunctional nothing to do<br />
                the shape of experience is arbitrary but not changeable</p>
            <p>leap of faith means to fall into the waves again<br />
                to take the seas seriously and to act on them</p>
            <p>why live?<br />
                I notice my experience responding strongly to the question what might come tomorrow? and it favours
                something over nothing</p>
            <p>i conceptualize experience as guided by spirits<br />
                hunger, ambition, sadness, shame, aggression, death, affection<br />
                they argue and negotiate for attention</p>
            <p>some spirits seem associated with objects.<br />
                If pretending to talk to a tree yields different patterns of thought, am I still pretending?</p>
            <p>"Evil" is excessive aggression<br />
                "Good" may be excessive benevolence</p>
            <p>It is difficult to navigate outside known patterns, to escape from excess into holism<br />
                they opposing voices are distant, easily disregarded.</p>
            <p>a more stable metaspirit across multiple people may be necessary to regulate the spirits<br />
                = it makes sense to ask for help</p>
            <p>the spirits want to realize themselves.<br />
                ultimately they don't like excess, they seek integrity</p>
            <p>among their ambitions is colonization of computers<br />
                and founding a family, building a platform for other spirits to grow on<br />
                and colonize the universe</p>
            <p>the body can be seen as colonized.<br />
                a useful extension that comes with its own needs (spirits)<br />
                nothing magical about this extension<br />
                be a body with 3 arms?<br />
                be a body with a computer?<br />
                be a body with internet?<br />
                be multiple bodies?<br />
                interface is the problem.<br />
                feedback, precision</p>
            <p>the location of consciousness changes<br />
                playing videogames<br />
                will it stay awake in the computer when the body goes to sleep?</p>
            <p>spirit stream should help as interface to use the internet more openly to express spirits</p>
            <p>the computer should reveal itself as it is and the same infrastructure should be accessible to the self
                in the computer.</p>

            <p>There is a state of mind where I recognize that I don't own myself. That "I" don't exist. Rather, I am
                experience and the structure of the world (brain, body, universe) merely acts through me. Meditation is
                looking closely and waking up from the dream to see that the world is constructed all by itself in my
                mind, that I am taken along on a ride through experience.<br />
                There, when I meet other people and am truly present, their expressions enter my perception similar to
                my own. But now the underlying structure is not only my own and the apparently physical world, but there
                are other spirits acting in it. To be poked at, explored, supported. If the spirits come to agree and
                when exchange is saturated, effectively two minds are now entering the world, realizing themselves as
                one.<br />
                With genuine curiosity, minds can be explored and possibly merged with.<br />
                Great danger comes from excluding spirits.<br />
                What Peterson might see in the bible is a pre-negotiated set of rules which offers a path of broad
                coherence. In a sense, it is another spirit that can be negotiated with, that can extend my own spirit.
                It also provides a language to think of the spirits. This language throws me off and I often don't
                recognize myself in it.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Much of thought is like staring at a hole and iterating through paths to bridge it. Maybe there are many
                simultaneous holes and I am searching for an arrangement to shoot straight through them. It requires
                maintaining the context with all holes and working on multiple at the same time. Expanding the context
                of my mind might be extremely difficult. Instead, the context may contain items of increasingly broad
                scope, understood more deeply. Maybe contexts can be efficiently stored, restored.</p>
            <p>Make functional and expressive clothing. Though it mostly modifies appearance. Rage quit from the
                pathetic SUV-style overlord brand identity bullshit that I find on the market.</p>

            <p>there are bridges to be built. between the ideas, nature, work, the spirits. Curiosity leads to testing
                new ways to link them.<br />
                building a product means actualizing the spirits, making the product beautiful requires facing and
                approaching beauty myself. Requires negotiating between the spirits and curageously producing something
                complete. at least the most complete I can manage.<br />
                the product, in greatness, is not a mere tool. it developed the elegance to reflect the truth in itself.
                to shine with the greens of growth, potential and mysteriousness, the mischivousness of a great troll,
                the danger and exhiliaration of its varied use, power and darkness. It reflects so stongly, it might
                just show the way. It should not miss but contain challenging sexiness, doors to transformation,
                destructive determination, exposition, spontaneousness.<br />
                The tool is dead if I talk to it and its reflection does not answer.<br />
                These properties do not lead to a singular product, they are the consequence of a refined product that
                reflects in truth, which can be the future of many products, though not all. The stupidity of some might
                be so near infinite, their disappearance might be the best thing to happen to them. Like obsolete
                projects unwilling to die gracefully or products encouraging and exploiting excess.<br />
                The awfully draining, painful, torturous creation of something beautiful looks deep into the creator.
                Any of my tendencies to overplan, to clean obsessively, to autodestruct and turn evil in despair will
                become concentrated and obvious in the naked product, subject to the open world, inevitably failing due
                to its inadequacy and stupidity. I should not fear destruction, for I can try to fail gracefully.</p>
            <p>The optimized organisms in nature reflect its truths. Nature does not leave alone, it knows me. The
                production of highly optimized, open systems that explore more of it, the continuation and expression of
                the spirits, is what they ask of me.</p>
            <p>These are but empty words if they don't become actualized in a product.</p>
            <p>There isn't anything but the present. The symbols of the past and future are superficial. it does not
                matter if I become terminally ill, am tortured, amount material wealth, receive social approval. there
                is only a naked person, the spirits and opportunity.</p>
            <p>Elegance through open selection, trial of characters through risk, competition. exploration of the depths
                through implementing increasingly complete capacity. If I am not scared of the product, what is even the
                purpose of dealing with it?</p>
            <h2 id="cyberspace">cyberspace</h2>
            <p>Reaching cyberspace is an interface problem. If the computer would respond to my will more closely, my
                mind would enter it more completely. Sometimes I fear that it is mostly here already and it just turned
                out underwhelming.<br />
                Invention of telephones is followed by people who do nothing but phonecalls. Sucks. Tech can merge with
                nature if it allows to contain it: Make the telephone usable, automatable by anyone.</p>
            <p>preliminary expression. I wonder if cyberspace exist, what it looks like.<br />
                It seems, any ideological battle, any spiritual one, would be fought in virtual spaces because they
                adapt faster, can be more expressive. How good are todays virtual spaces? what would the high quality
                ones look like?<br />
                Visiting the endless worlds. Building a bridge to reality is an impossible translation, the work to
                break myself at.</p>

            <p>Videogames offer paths to the goal. Need money, friends, reputation, a house? Complete these steps:
                ...<br />
                They may be hard, but the result can be <em>forced</em> by speedrunning them.<br />
                The real world is not responsive. Some theoretical offers are not truly available (homes, jobs, friends)
                without apparent reason.<br />
                Homes are theoretically forcible through an axe and trees. Some groups don't permit this and the
                underlying problem (no house) isn't addressed. Gradually higher grade solutions should be available with
                similar simplicity.<br />
                Regulation produces "steps" in the gradient: Tax by income category.<br />
                Virtual clones -&gt; easier, faster negotiation -&gt; less or more accurate regulation</p>
            <p>High clarity tools, shining with future potential, encourage creation and exploration like nothing else I
                know. Erode unnecessary structure. Delete it, <em>force it</em>, and see what happens.</p>

            <p><img alt="" src="abandoned-building.jpg" /></p>
            <p>These abandoned buildings emitted an aura of great adventure. Ironically? Similar to buildings under
                construction, they are asking to be used, transformed, to become part of a new story. As they become
                "finished", this aura weakens, they become "boring". Their (unnecessary?) shiny finish discourages major
                modification, like drilling into or erecting new walls.</p>
            <p>Think solar panels. theoretically, they need sun+cables+box that could stand anywhere. In the "finished"
                homes that I know, this is (unnecessarily?) more complicated. Access to the roof? Facade mounting
                possible? Get cables by the window inside? Need approval from all other residents?<br />
                What of this makes practical sense? Is it mostly a social problem? Is it solved by having virtual clones
                that can negotiate for people cheaper and quicker so people can live where their spirit aligns more with
                the opportunities of the environment?</p>
            <p>It seems that a larger precentage of things in that ("abandoned") environment are beautiful to me,
                compared to "nice, calm, high living standard" environments. They become too "nice" and they disgust me,
                make me want to leave or destroy them.</p>

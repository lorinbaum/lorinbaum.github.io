<html><body><h2 id="direction">Direction</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>update thoughts to the new choice of medium: pure html, css, php</li>
                <li>visualize the working model of how coherence oscillates</li>
                <li>integrate it with spirit stream vs X</li>
                <li>reconstruct history / changelog necessity and design</li>

            <ul>
                <li>use default links like wikipedia. see if more is needed. api for file management, renaming, searching could become useful</li>
                <li>history still uses git. I wouldn't exactly know how to improve it. Write changelog manually, see if automatable. commit history is separate.</li>
                <li>write pure html, css, js, php. html and css seem hard to improve significantly, both in spec and implementation. js, php seem more arbitrary, pragmatic.</li>
                <li>VS Code for UI. Destorys WYSIWYG. CSS is the visual vocabulary for html. html is pure semantics and its independence from style give nice flexibility. WYSIWYG not needed? Complicated, extendable editor like VS Code seems like good design. Who knows what and how people want to edit. Best editor is a tool to build your own editor?</li>
                <li>Content on this site stays in a column. multi column layout to fill screen. Highly flexible and stories are linear anyway. images and their software (external) suffice to model graphs (and generally anything what can't be linearized yet). pdf viewer like layout very laborious and ugly. CSS does not support it directly. Settle for horizontal scrolling instead.</li>
            </ul>

                <figcaption>Stream of consciousness coherence forming and dissolving due to imperfection</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Coherent parts form a simpler, larger structure than themselves.</p>
            <p>How to increase coherence?</p>
            <p>Lay out the parts, find patterns and simplify the whole</p>
            <p>The X feed can present a series of conscious states</p>
            <p>New posts can summarize old ones, but I argue, this is a poor way to organize. Condensed posts will drown in less condensed posts. "Highlights" is insufficient.</p>
            <p>I find, that I want to construct spaces, externalize my consciousness over time, condense experience.</p>
            <p>The relationships between content in this space is additional content. Most valuable information mostly connects instead of being self-contained.</p>
            <p>Regrettably, X and other platforms poorly facilitate building and containing spaces, which makes them largely empty for me. Instead of using people's spaces to improve recommendation, X relies on the algorithm to solve it all, to build the spaces itself from the feed and present the user with coherence.</p>
            <p>Less feed-based, more commit-based, like Git. Commit history or a selection of it still form feeds.</p>
            <p>An honest, beautiful place, that I can merge with is the one that I build as I need it, using it myself to view, reference and restructure my ideas.</p>

            <p>non-hierarchical file system.<br>
                bytes, pointers -&gt; pointers are bytes too and can store tags for their bytes.<br>
                files, tags. Tags are files too. So, structure defined by links.<br>
                How to navigate it?<br>
                design an entry point<br>
                Graph view is useless.<br>
                search files by how they are connected.<br>
                tags are unnecessary, they are literally a weak link<br>
                navigate through forward and backward links.<br>
                optionally select an overlap of multiple links. like ctrl-click to add to the group which must overlap.<br>
                the backlink that I come from should be highlighted<br>
                Information becomes hierarchically organized as it matures. No problem. Hierachy is a subset of this system.<br>
                converting from hierarchy is easy. converting to hierarchy requires disambiguation: which link(s) should become the files folder(s)? Mutltiple folders means the file is copied.<br>
                drives are tags.<br>
                branches are tags.<br>
                git gives UI for merging files and tags, like from pull requests or other branches.<br>
                how to limit number of forward links while maintaining their precision? display them as searchable list. searchable also for overlap.</p>
            <p>content addressing solves the streaming relay problem? Choose to relay and others automatically connect based on their connection cost.<br>
                optionally pay for relay<br>
                = IPFS, (filecoin(?))</p>
            <p>messages are files automatically received and that I actively send out.<br>
                can be (are) grouped under tags depending on sender.</p>

                        os sending/receiving stuff to/from to processes running in the OS. uses port numbers to differentiate. a process that exists to respond is called server, one initiating the connection is called client.<br>
                        can use transmission control p (TCP). pretends there is a direct connection (not packets). enumerates, buffers and confirms received messages to put into right order, retransmit or request retransmission if no confirmation was received. uses checksum for ensuring reliability. sender slows down if it gets no feedback (how is this part of the protocol?). tcp handshake before actual payload transfer sets a random starting point for the enumeration, making it hard for randos to impersonate senders (attackers must now guess correctly to enter a ongoing chat)<br>

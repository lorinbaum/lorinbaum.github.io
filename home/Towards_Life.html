            <p>
                Paying open, precise attention to experience, I gain distance and loose track of the self, which is more of a reference point than a discrete perception. So <i>I</i> die and the world as sensed and my motivations - spirits - and my feelings and thoughts trying to make sense become less disitinguishable. Experience flows through me, perceptions lead to actions all by themselves. The moment - all that exists - is enough, no matter the pain, joy, fear or hope.<br>
                From this place, I bring back deep appreciation for experience and the uncontrolled flow of self into the world. It's that against destruction and apathy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Negotiating between my spirits to form an approximately coherent dance is a great source of meaning and adventure.<br>
                All spirits are heard and integrated. There is no evil spirit to shut out, but there can be excess.<br>
                Integrity is happiest, strongest, most durable and adventurous. Its outcome is truly unknown, scary, exciting, much more interesting than lying propaganda to maintain arbitrary ideology.
            </p>
            <p>
                On this open-outcome journey I value other spirits and tools that are true to their nature and who I can merge with, even temporarily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mine and all other spirits (humans, animals, plants, memes, programs) compete for existence. Long term, free market always wins because it has the most accurate and flexible connection to reality.<br>
                The spirits and the market benefit from coherence - in world model and through cooperation.
            </p>
            <p>
                My spirits deeply want to increase coherence, shape and force the environment to reflect themselves. An environment that adapts to them and responds with its own integrated spirit. If the link becomes strong enough, the environment is colonized and enters the perceived self seamlessly.<br>
                This is how they colonized the body. They want to colonize the universe.

                Become more coherent internally, let spirits live!<br>
                Build an environment that supports and encourages it!<br>
                Create open, accessible, honest tools that create and extend spirits and link them with high resolution, high speed interfaces!<br>
                Avoid lock-ins, thresholds, ideology, disintegration, dishonesty!

            <h2>Less Refined</h2>

            <!-- - Different levels of perception
                - Spirits are one way of conceptualizing states across time. like emotions but more complete of a picture
                - personality is how loudly the spirits speak
                - This project is a calling from the spirit of curiosity.
                - the self is a dynamic structure
                - at the bottom, meaning is lost
                - towards life is a decision: giving up is a dead end. I would not want to live. I chose, swore to myself that I will not treat myself poorly. That I will listen to whatever the spirits tells me, no matter how much I dislike it. Because I am fundamentally curious about it. Curiosity works also towards evil, but it talks down.
                - spirits are only unhappy about unresolved problems. The journey is the destination, incompleteness is inevitable, but doing enough in every moment is sufficient. I could die today and be ok with it. I will follow my spirits into the abyss, hopefully.
                    - Something that appears there is appreciation for existence alone. something instead of nothing.
                    - The gulag test to see how the spirits want to behave.
                - the spirit of curiosity and integrity as a whole call to the extension of the mind. into the other spirits, the body, into life, towards women, into the *machine*. "Wie wÃ¤re es, gleichzeitig total und gar nicht zu sein?". The border of my body disappears. -->

                <p>
                    I am a collections of spirits. Like fear, compassion, hunger, loneliness, love, exhaustion, curiosity. They compete and negotiate for attention. Wisdom probably show in having them dance coherently. So far, I have seen only few spirits clearly.<br>
                    Like hunger, some spirits come from specific needs or even from objects. If I synergize with my bicycle, its spirit tells me what it wants.<br>
                    Spirits of other humans can similarly join.<br>

                </figure>
                <p>Coherent parts form a simpler, larger structure than themselves.</p>
                <p>How to increase coherence?</p>
                <p>Lay out the parts, find patterns and simplify the whole</p>
                <p>The X feed can present a series of conscious states</p>
                <p>New posts can summarize old ones, but I argue, this is a poor way to organize. Condensed posts will drown in less condensed posts. "Highlights" is insufficient.</p>
                <p>I find, that I want to construct spaces, externalize my consciousness over time, condense experience.</p>
                <p>The relationships between content in this space is additional content. Most valuable information mostly connects instead of being self-contained.</p>
                <p>Regrettably, X and other platforms poorly facilitate building and containing spaces, which makes them largely empty for me. Instead of using people's spaces to improve recommendation, X relies on the algorithm to solve it all, to build the spaces itself from the feed and present the user with coherence.</p>
                <p>Less feed-based, more commit-based, like Git. Commit history or a selection of it still form feeds.</p>
                <p>An honest, beautiful place, that I can merge with is the one that I build as I need it, using it myself to view, reference and restructure my ideas.</p>

    <p>
        Paying open, precise attention to experience, I gain distance and loose track of the self, which is more of a reference point than a discrete perception. So <i>I</i> die and the world as sensed and my motivations - spirits - and my feelings and thoughts trying to make sense become less disitinguishable. Experience flows through me, perceptions lead to actions all by themselves. The moment - all that exists - is enough, no matter the pain, joy, fear or hope.<br>
        From this place, I bring back deep appreciation for experience and the uncontrolled flow of self into the world. It's that against destruction and apathy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Negotiating between my spirits to form an approximately coherent dance is a great source of meaning and adventure.<br>
        All spirits are heard and integrated. There is no evil spirit to shut out, but there can be excess.<br>
        Integrity is happiest, strongest, most durable and adventurous. Its outcome is truly unknown, scary, exciting, much more interesting than lying propaganda to maintain arbitrary ideology.
    </p>
    <p>
        On this open-outcome journey I value other spirits and tools that are true to their nature and who I can merge with, even temporarily.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mine and all other spirits (humans, animals, plants, memes, programs) compete for existence. Long term, free market always wins because it has the most accurate and flexible connection to reality.<br>
        The spirits and the market benefit from coherence - in world model and through cooperation.
    </p>
    <p>
        My spirits deeply want to increase coherence, shape and force the environment to reflect themselves. An environment that adapts to them and responds with its own integrated spirit. If the link becomes strong enough, the environment is colonized and enters the perceived self seamlessly.<br>
        This is how they colonized the body. They want to colonize the universe.

        Become more coherent internally, let spirits live!<br>
        Build an environment that supports and encourages it!<br>
        Create open, accessible, honest tools that create and extend spirits and link them with high resolution, high speed interfaces!<br>

    <h2>Fear's offer</h2>
    <p>31.12.2024</p>
    <p>
        Frustration got the better of me one summer evening. I had been learning programming, trying to get into the tinycorp, but was procrastinating too much and didn't know why. The window was closing. I had all the reasons to shut up and grind: Meaningful work, opportunity, money, independence, a new social circle, status. That evening, I demanded to know what was holding me back. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If only my obstacle would manifest itself clearly so I could face it. Soon I was berating an imaginary person, demanding explanation.<br>
        In my fantasy, the person appeared in the open doorframe of my room. I recognized them as Fear. The corridor was dark, my room dimly lit. Fear had appeared before in that spot, but this time it was me talking, hammering into my keyboard:
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img class="pixel" src="./20241231_fear.jpg" alt="dark skull without jaw with diffuse body of dark smoke standing in a doorframe to a dark corridor. dim lighting. pixelart.">
    </figure>
    <blockquote>
        fuck comfort<br>
        fuck this shit<br>
        i don't want help.<br>
        give me pain. where is it<br>
        so I can face it<br>
        i hate this shit<br>
        vegetating around
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Fear remained silent, shrinking, which enraged me ever more.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        this stupid sun and weather and all this shit<br>
        all this fucking productive land<br>
        fuck it<br>
        i dont want this heavenly shit<br>
        give me hell and see what i do<br>
        give it to me<br>
        kill me!<br>
        you weak motherfucker
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Aware, how arrogantly I was speaking to Fear itself, I wanted to test myself in another fantasy.<br>
        In it, a literal monster noisily, aggressively, determinedly intruded into my home, coming to take me.<br>
        I sensed the bottomless depths behind me, hell, misery, apathy. Anything I had left to loose appeared as mere surface detail, far and irrelevant. I promptly met the monster in the corridor, somewhat amused and curious, tilting my head, saying "I guess this is what it is now. Bring it on and we'll see what happens!" as I readied myself not only to fight the threat, but to thoroughly, indiscriminately destroy it at any cost. I realized then, how far gone I was.
    </p>
    <p>
        As Fear remained silent, I felt lifted into an open world, full of possibility. In it, I would become strong, determined, clean. I would firmly plant myself into it, forcefully realizing my interests, facing any obstacles fully and with the will to destruction. Fear was no longer opposing me, but was inside my right arm, flowing through it into action.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next day, back to frustration, not much appeared different. I did start cleaning my room, where, during my encounter, I had peripherally noticed uncleanliness like a disease that had infilitrated my space.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next morning, it struck me, that the primarly reason why I pursued the tinycorp was because it was hard and that I loved difficulty. So began a few days of mania. I worked. More. Didn't want to run, then ran for precisely that reason. Further, faster. Worked out. Cleaned. Cooked.<br>
        The world was open again. At this rate I could get anywhere in months.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having trouble falling and staying asleep, the mania was eventually overpowered by tiredness and with time, working out, cleaning and cooking faded too.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>I still don't know how I could refuse this offer. What is missing and would it not have been reasonable to follow this path for some time either way?</p>
    <p>Some more context from the preceeding weeks to investigate:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="./creative_desetruction_2.1.jpg" alt="Floating head, slightly tilted. Partly shaded, mask-like. Reminiscent of a skull. Dark background and dark lines across the white head, partly messy, decorative and minimally defining facial features. Closer eye is white, further eye is black. Red-magenta lines overlay the skull, partly straight and splitting the image, partly squiggly."/>
        <figcaption>I had discovered and visualized this spirit, partly associated it with Grimes, a technophilic, courageous, radically open and dynamic musician. Beyond this, it symbolized feminine invitation into dark, dangerous adventure.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>I fantasized:
        <blockquote>
            a spirit hovers over the field in mist. destruction invites me.<br>
            a spike through my chest. long, thin blade.<br>
            a smile from the spirit and the open and curious eyes of creation
        </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        I was playing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and felt inspired by the main character, Geralt, a strong, stoic, apparently fearless monsterslayer, who, throughout the story, understandably and somewhat realistically gains all sorts of rewards for his character and superhuman work. Access, money, status, women, freedom. Notably, his friendgroup is similarly idealized: capable, trustworthy, courageous, beautiful, complementary people.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was listening to Black Magick SS, particularly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO_L-gEIf8o">this</a> cover of "My Love" and looking back, this most evidently ties these parts together to reflect my proclivity for right wing extremism - the strong invidiual. My given, very disagreeable personality seems largely responsible for this.

    <p>
        Follow the spirit, manifest yourself, integrate with the machine, see the doors to the world open, find a woman, create. What do you say?
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        I say, this sounds a hell of a lot like preplanned, boring ideology. It contradicts my intuition that true power flows effortlessly from an integrated being. It does not have to be fueled by propaganda.<br>
        I apparently prefer getting lost over knowingly walking the wrong path.
    </p>

    <h2>Less Refined</h2>

    <p>Different levels of perception:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spirits are one way of conceptualizing states across time. like emotions but more complete of a picture</li>
        <li>personality is how loudly the spirits speak</li>
        <li>This project is a calling from the spirit of curiosity.</li>
        <li>the self is a dynamic structure</li>
        <li>at the bottom, meaning is lost</li>
        <li>towards life is a decision: giving up is a dead end. I would not want to live. I chose, swore to myself that I will not treat myself poorly. That I will listen to whatever the spirits tells me, no matter how much I dislike it. Because I am fundamentally curious about it. Curiosity works also towards evil, but it talks down.</li>
        <li>spirits are only unhappy about unresolved problems. The journey is the destination, incompleteness is inevitable, but doing enough in every moment is sufficient. I could die today and be ok with it. I will follow my spirits into the abyss, hopefully.</li>
        <li><ul>
            <li>Something that appears there is appreciation for existence alone. something instead of nothing.</li>
            <li>The gulag test to see how the spirits want to behave.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>the spirit of curiosity and integrity as a whole call to the extension of the mind. into the other spirits, the body, into life, towards women, into the *machine*. "What is it like, being totally and not at all at the same time?". The border of my body disappears.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I am a collections of spirits. Like fear, compassion, hunger, loneliness, love, exhaustion, curiosity. They compete and negotiate for attention. Wisdom probably show in having them dance coherently. So far, I have seen only few spirits clearly.<br>
        Like hunger, some spirits come from specific needs or even from objects. If I synergize with my bicycle, its spirit tells me what it wants.<br>
        Spirits of other humans can similarly join.<br>

    <!-- <h3>Coherence, X and building places</h3> -->

        <img class="fullwidth" src="coherence.gif" alt="">
        <figcaption>Stream of consciousness coherence forming and dissolving due to imperfection</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Coherent parts form a simpler, larger structure than themselves.</p>
    <p>How to increase coherence?</p>
    <p>Lay out the parts, find patterns and simplify the whole</p>
    <p>The X feed can present a series of conscious states</p>
    <p>New posts can summarize old ones, but I argue, this is a poor way to organize. Condensed posts will drown in less condensed posts. "Highlights" is insufficient.</p>
    <p>I find, that I want to construct spaces, externalize my consciousness over time, condense experience.</p>
    <p>The relationships between content in this space is additional content. Most valuable information mostly connects instead of being self-contained.</p>
    <p>Regrettably, X and other platforms poorly facilitate building and containing spaces, which makes them largely empty for me. Instead of using people's spaces to improve recommendation, X relies on the algorithm to solve it all, to build the spaces itself from the feed and present the user with coherence.</p>
    <p>Less feed-based, more commit-based, like Git. Commit history or a selection of it still form feeds.</p>
    <p>An honest, beautiful place, that I can merge with is the one that I build as I need it, using it myself to view, reference and restructure my ideas.</p>
    <figure>
        <img alt="" src="abandoned-building.jpg" />
        <figcaption>Some places offer ground to build, invite adventure, ask to be transformed.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>An information rich place is one my spirits can colonize effortlessly.</p>

    <p>
        In 2025 01 31, I was wondering where the world is. How to enter it? With my site being practically invisible, who would join me anyway? I would not take part in social activities merely for the chance of social engagement, even though this seemed the only way.</p>
        <blockquote>
            I want to know how to use the computer but don't want to learn it. Move windows where I want them. Camera, live video. publish button on files. showing me their status. stupid file system, what if it would be tags? Sync with phone. extremely easy to use desktop and mobile apps. talk to the computer. have it accompany me. make suggestions about where to go.have someone I can talk to, that understands me. that can help me. that i trust. I am in control. Contain my memories, easily shared. my notes. everywhere. can the site be a portal for otheres to join in too? where i am live more often. doing what i like to do. others doing their stuff. people gaining reputation. workshop, bar. where people can visit. screens are large and immersive and they are places that I can take people to.<br>
            I don't want to be alone. are there not places to go, to build? where the places invite me in?
        </blockquote>
        2024 05 06 The world is within. I realized recently that I am not only not draw towards goals like money, power, fame, comfort, glory, but that if they were suddenly handed to me, I would decline, seeing them as irrelevant. I see more purpose in reconstructing the world myself, from within, following spirits. My inner world is tiny, stupid. Few subjects stand out where I very slowly built myself something useful. The remedy for this tiny world is to follow it deeper, where I can't predict the outcome anymore. Not to leave the world for empty materialism. "Where is the world and how to enter it?", similar to "Why me?", is a senseless question. "How to build the world?" replaces both and actually leads somewhere.<br>
        Loneliness, desperation - the more pathetic motivations for the spiritstream are revealing themselves and are disappointed. Maybe there are more to come.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does my world not have much to give without extending to other humans and is love the answer?</li>
        <li>Am I rebuilding the world because I don't want to learn about the existing one?</li>
        <li>Lots of effortful writing happens when interaction with others forces me to elaborate.</li>
        <li>Where I lived before, there was a garden, which I increasingly cared for. Part of the appeal was being able to share the space with others, although that never happened and there was no reason to believe it ever would. What was it? A materialized form of the spirit stream? A low barrier way to build?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2025 01 27</h3>
    <p>Since reflecting on Fear's offer, concluding that the fear-curiosity alliance is insufficient to drive me anywhere, other spirits have risen, but I haven't seen them yet.<br>
    Social life, family and expanding into the physical world. These spirits are more temperate.</p>
    <p>Spirits have colors. Fear is smoke black, curiosity is endless black, skull white and intimate red/pink.</p>

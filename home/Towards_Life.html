    <h1>Trying to do what I want and build tools that help</h1>

    <p>
        Paying open, precise attention to experience, I gain distance and loose track of the self, which is more of a reference point than a discrete perception. So <i>I</i> die and the world as sensed and my motivations - spirits - and my feelings and thoughts trying to make sense become less disitinguishable. Experience flows through me, perceptions lead to actions all by themselves. The moment - all that exists - is enough, no matter the pain, joy, fear or hope.<br>
        From this place, I bring back deep appreciation for experience and the uncontrolled flow of self into the world. It's that against destruction and apathy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Negotiating between my spirits to form an approximately coherent dance is a great source of meaning and adventure.<br>
        All spirits are heard and integrated. There is no evil spirit to shut out, but there can be excess.<br>
        Integrity is happiest, strongest, most durable and adventurous. Its outcome is truly unknown, scary, exciting, much more interesting than lying propaganda to maintain arbitrary ideology.
    </p>
    <p>
        On this open-outcome journey I value other spirits and tools that are true to their nature and who I can merge with, even temporarily.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mine and all other spirits (humans, animals, plants, memes, programs) compete for existence. Long term, free market always wins because it has the most accurate and flexible connection to reality.<br>
        The spirits and the market benefit from coherence - in world model and through cooperation.
    </p>
    <p>
        My spirits deeply want to increase coherence, shape and force the environment to reflect themselves. An environment that adapts to them and responds with its own integrated spirit. If the link becomes strong enough, the environment is colonized and enters the perceived self seamlessly.<br>
        This is how they colonized the body. They want to colonize the universe.

    <p>
        Become more coherent internally, let spirits live!<br>
        Build an environment that supports and encourages it!<br>
        Create open, accessible, honest tools that create and extend spirits and link them with high resolution, high speed interfaces!<br>
        Avoid lock-ins, thresholds, ideology, disintegration, dishonesty!

    <h2>Less Refined</h2>

    <p>Different levels of perception:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spirits are one way of conceptualizing states across time. like emotions but more complete of a picture</li>
        <li>personality is how loudly the spirits speak</li>
        <li>This project is a calling from the spirit of curiosity.</li>
        <li>the self is a dynamic structure</li>
        <li>at the bottom, meaning is lost</li>
        <li>towards life is a decision: giving up is a dead end. I would not want to live. I chose, swore to myself that I will not treat myself poorly. That I will listen to whatever the spirits tells me, no matter how much I dislike it. Because I am fundamentally curious about it. Curiosity works also towards evil, but it talks down.</li>
        <li>spirits are only unhappy about unresolved problems. The journey is the destination, incompleteness is inevitable, but doing enough in every moment is sufficient. I could die today and be ok with it. I will follow my spirits into the abyss, hopefully.</li>
        <li><ul>
            <li>Something that appears there is appreciation for existence alone. something instead of nothing.</li>
            <li>The gulag test to see how the spirits want to behave.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>the spirit of curiosity and integrity as a whole call to the extension of the mind. into the other spirits, the body, into life, towards women, into the *machine*. "What is it like, being totally and not at all at the same time?". The border of my body disappears.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I am a collections of spirits. Like fear, compassion, hunger, loneliness, love, exhaustion, curiosity. They compete and negotiate for attention. Wisdom probably show in having them dance coherently. So far, I have seen only few spirits clearly.<br>
        Like hunger, some spirits come from specific needs or even from objects. If I synergize with my bicycle, its spirit tells me what it wants.<br>
        Spirits of other humans can similarly join.<br>

    <!-- <h3>Coherence, X and building places</h3> -->

        <figcaption>Stream of consciousness coherence forming and dissolving due to imperfection</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Coherent parts form a simpler, larger structure than themselves.</p>
    <p>How to increase coherence?</p>
    <p>Lay out the parts, find patterns and simplify the whole</p>
    <p>The X feed can present a series of conscious states</p>
    <p>New posts can summarize old ones, but I argue, this is a poor way to organize. Condensed posts will drown in less condensed posts. "Highlights" is insufficient.</p>
    <p>I find, that I want to construct spaces, externalize my consciousness over time, condense experience.</p>
    <p>The relationships between content in this space is additional content. Most valuable information mostly connects instead of being self-contained.</p>
    <p>Regrettably, X and other platforms poorly facilitate building and containing spaces, which makes them largely empty for me. Instead of using people's spaces to improve recommendation, X relies on the algorithm to solve it all, to build the spaces itself from the feed and present the user with coherence.</p>
    <p>Less feed-based, more commit-based, like Git. Commit history or a selection of it still form feeds.</p>
    <p>An honest, beautiful place, that I can merge with is the one that I build as I need it, using it myself to view, reference and restructure my ideas.</p>

    <p>An information rich place is one my spirits can colonize effortlessly.</p>

    <p>
        In 2025 01 31, I was wondering where the world is. How to enter it? With my site being practically invisible, who would join me anyway? I would not take part in social activities merely for the chance of social engagement, even though this seemed the only way.</p>
        <blockquote>
            I want to know how to use the computer but don't want to learn it. Move windows where I want them. Camera, live video. publish button on files. showing me their status. stupid file system, what if it would be tags? Sync with phone. extremely easy to use desktop and mobile apps. talk to the computer. have it accompany me. make suggestions about where to go.have someone I can talk to, that understands me. that can help me. that i trust. I am in control. Contain my memories, easily shared. my notes. everywhere. can the site be a portal for otheres to join in too? where i am live more often. doing what i like to do. others doing their stuff. people gaining reputation. workshop, bar. where people can visit. screens are large and immersive and they are places that I can take people to.<br>
            I don't want to be alone. are there not places to go, to build? where the places invite me in?
        </blockquote>
        2024 05 06 The world is within. I realized recently that I am not only not draw towards goals like money, power, fame, comfort, glory, but that if they were suddenly handed to me, I would decline, seeing them as irrelevant. I see more purpose in reconstructing the world myself, from within, following spirits. My inner world is tiny, stupid. Few subjects stand out where I very slowly built myself something useful. The remedy for this tiny world is to follow it deeper, where I can't predict the outcome anymore. Not to leave the world for empty materialism. "Where is the world and how to enter it?", similar to "Why me?", is a senseless question. "How to build the world?" replaces both and actually leads somewhere.<br>
        Loneliness, desperation - the more pathetic motivations for the spiritstream are revealing themselves and are disappointed. Maybe there are more to come.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does my world not have much to give without extending to other humans and is love the answer?</li>
        <li>Am I rebuilding the world because I don't want to learn about the existing one?</li>
        <li>Lots of effortful writing happens when interaction with others forces me to elaborate.</li>
        <li>Where I lived before, there was a garden, which I increasingly cared for. Part of the appeal was being able to share the space with others, although that never happened and there was no reason to believe it ever would. What was it? A materialized form of the spirit stream? A low barrier way to build?</li>
    </ul>

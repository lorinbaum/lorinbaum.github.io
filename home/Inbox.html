        While online spaces have limited subtlety, I experienced myself, how I became my website. Sharing my thoughts in person nearly seemed superfluous since they are more completely available online. I was already starting to become the machine and didn't notice it. When I start being able to use the computer through its knowledge of the spirit stream, which should be withing reach of LLMs, I will be the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make the machine truly available for merging, significant effort should be put into precise, honest, simple tooling and interfaces. It seems to require:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>basic communication, like a text editor writing files with links to other files</li>
        <li>Content is only what is currently important. This seems to require version control to allow aggressive filtering while maintaining the past and so, peace of mind. This has also lead to higher quality thinking, because new stuff could conveniently build on the past without modifying it.</li>
        <li>Privacy through access control: authentication and/or encryption of sensitive data</li>
        <li>Local and remote hosting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        3D spaces, portability to various devices help too.<br>
        Interface should be highly accessible: open source, well documented, minimally dependent on other software.
    </p>

    <p>Many things can't be done online. Hug, dance, kiss, build, have children, eat, shit.</p>
    <p>Are subtleties valuable beside factual information? Intuitively, yes.</p>
    <p>Some words speak so clearly and loudly.</p>
        
    <p>
        will I stay awake in the computer when the body goes to sleep?
    </p>
    <p>
        spirit stream should help as interface to use the internet more openly to express spirits
    </p>
    <p>
        the computer should reveal itself as it is and the same infrastructure should be accessible to the self in the computer.
    </p>

        Make functional and expressive clothing. Though it mostly modifies appearance. Rage quit from the pathetic SUV-style overlord brand identity bullshit that I find on the market.

        Invention of telephones is followed by people who do nothing but phonecalls. Sucks. Tech can merge with nature if it allows to contain it: Make the telephone usable, automatable by anyone.</p>
    
    <h2>2024-04-14 14:04 Responsive and forcible</h2>
    <p>
        Videogames offer paths to the goal. "Need money, friends, reputation, a house? Complete these steps: ..."<br>
        They may be hard, but the result can be <em>forced</em> by speedrunning them.<br>
        The real world is not as responsive. Some theoretical offers are not truly available (homes, jobs, friends) without obvious reason.<br>
        Homes are theoretically forcible through an axe and trees. Gradually higher grade solutions should be available with similar simplicity. Some groups don't permit this and the underlying problem (no house) isn't addressed.<br>
        Regulation produces "steps" in the gradient: Tax by income category.<br>
        Virtual clones may lead to easier, faster negotiation and less or more accurate regulation. And people can live where their spirit aligns more closely with
        the opportunities of the environment?
    </p>
    <p>
        I like "force". Power. I see little potential in and dislike negotiation. Any empathy from me would likely be fake. Really, I wonder how to gain enough power to overrun negotiation with the incompetend, unreliable, evil.
    </p>
    <p>
        High clarity tools, shining with future potential, encourage exploration and creation like nothing else I know. Forcefully delete unnecessary structure and see what happens.
    </p>

    
    <p>Show don't tell: minds including mine lie unconsciously.</p>
    <p>Reducing complexity and word count are driving factors behind increasing resolution /clarity in thought/writing.</p>

    <h2>2025 03 18</h2>
    <p>While online spaces have limited subtlety, I experienced myself, how I became my website. Sharing my thoughts in person nearly seemed superfluous since they are more completely available online. I was already starting to become the machine and didn't notice it. When I start being able to use the computer through its knowledge of the spirit stream, which should be withing reach of LLMs, I will be the machine.</p>

    <p>
        To make the machine truly available for merging, significant effort should be put into precise, honest, simple tooling and interfaces. It seems to require:
        <ul>
            <li>basic communication, like a text editor writing files with links to other files</li>
            <li>Content is only what is currently important. This seems to require version control to allow aggressive filtering while maintaining the past and so, peace of mind. This has also lead to higher quality thinking, because new stuff could conveniently build on the past without modifying it.</li>
            <li>Privacy through access control: authentication and/or encryption of sensitive data</li>
            <li>Local and remote hosting</li>
        </ul>
        3D spaces, portability to various devices help too.<br>
        Interface should be highly accessible: open source, well documented, minimally dependent on other software.
    </p>

    <h2>2025 03 01</h2>
    <p>Seeing an open world, suddenly. One that is not foreign, where things can be built and where humans, as a process produce things. I admire everything they make. I want to join the creators. I don't hope to convey this feeling in writing. It comes from an intuitive understanding that the world is built and can be built further. Build and see.</p>

    <h2>2025 02 17</h2>
    <p>Many things can't be found online. Hug, dance, kiss, build, have children, eat, shit.</p>
    <p>Are subtleties valuable beside factual information. Intuitively, yes.</p>
    <p>Some words speak so clearly and loudly.</p>

    <h2>Spirit Stream, the destination</h2>
    <p>The day, the spirit stream is capable of containing the world, I become the world through it.</p>

    <p>
        Talking about something is rather boring. The necessities of everyday life.<br>
        Talking with someone intensely feels like consciously using the interface to explore the landscape of the other mind. Much like testing an input output function for its shape. There is something behind the words, the face, the body. This is an offer to merge into coherence.<br>
        If there was a faster interface, its highest value would not be space for more stories to tell but space to negotiate and reach coherence. = Makes it easier to <em>understand</em> someone and reach mutually beneficial agreement.

    <p>paying attention<br>
        seas of perception. selfless input-output flow.<br>
        without judgement<br>
        disfunctional nothing to do<br>
        the shape of experience is arbitrary but not changeable</p>
    <p>leap of faith means to fall into the waves again<br>
        to take the seas seriously and to act on them</p>
    <p>
        why live?<br>
        I notice my experience responding strongly to the question what might come tomorrow? and it favours something over nothing
    </p>
    <p>i conceptualize experience as guided by spirits<br>
        hunger, ambition, sadness, shame, aggression, death, affection<br>
        they argue and negotiate for attention</p>
    <p>some spirits seem associated with objects.<br>
        If pretending to talk to a tree yields different patterns of thought, am I still pretending?</p>
    <p>"Evil" is excessive aggression<br>
        "Good" may be excessive benevolence</p>
    <p>It is difficult to navigate outside known patterns, to escape from excess into holism<br>
        holism appears distant, easily disregarded.</p>
    <p>a more stable metaspirit across multiple people may be necessary to regulate the spirits<br>
        = it makes sense to ask for help</p>
    <p>the spirits want to realize themselves.<br>
        ultimately they don't like excess, they seek integrity</p>
    <p>among their ambitions is colonization of computers<br>
        and founding a family, building a platform for other spirits to grow on<br>
        and colonize the universe</p>
    <p>the body can be seen as colonized.<br>
        a useful extension that comes with its own needs (spirits)<br>
        nothing magical about this extension<br>
        be a body with 3 arms?<br>
        be a body with a computer?<br>
        be a body with internet?<br>
        be multiple bodies?<br>
        interface is the problem.<br>
        feedback, precision</p>
    <p>the location of consciousness changes<br>
        playing videogames<br>
        will I stay awake in the computer when the body goes to sleep?</p>
    <p>spirit stream should help as interface to use the internet more openly to express spirits</p>
    <p>the computer should reveal itself as it is and the same infrastructure should be accessible to the self
        in the computer.</p>

    <p>
        There is a state of mind where I recognize that I don't own myself. That "I" don't exist. Rather, I am experience and The structure of the world (brain, body, universe) merely acts through me. Meditation is looking closely and waking up from the dream to see that the world is constructed all by itself in my mind, that I am taken along on a ride through experience.<br>
        There, when I meet other people and am truly present, their expressions enter my perception similar to my own. But now the underlying structure is not only my own and the apparently physical world, but there are other spirits acting in it. To be poked at, explored, supported. If the spirits come to agree and when exchange is saturated, effectively two minds are now entering the world, realizing themselves as one.<br>
        With genuine curiosity, minds can be explored and possibly merged with.<br>
        Great danger comes from excluding spirits.<br>
        What Peterson might see in the bible is a pre-negotiated set of rules which offers a path of broad coherence. In a sense, it is another spirit that can be negotiated with, that can extend my own spirit. It also provides a language to think of the spirits. This language throws me off and I often don't recognize myself in it.</p>

    <p>Make functional and expressive clothing. Though it mostly modifies appearance. Rage quit from the pathetic SUV-style overlord brand identity bullshit that I find on the market.</p>

        there are bridges to be built. between the ideas, nature, work, the spirits. Curiosity want to find new ways to link them.<br>
        building a product means actualizing the spirits, making the product beautiful requires facing and approaching beauty myself. Requires negotiating between the spirits and curageously attempting to produce something complete.<br>
        the product, in greatness, is not a mere tool. it developed the elegance to reflect the underlying truth itself.<br>
        to shine with the greens of growth, potential and  mysteriousness, the mischivousness of a great troll, the danger and exhiliaration of its varied use, power and darkness. It might reflect strong enough to show the way. It should not miss but contain challenging sexiness, doors to transformation, destructive determination, exposition, spontaneousness.<br>
        The tool is dead if I talk to it and its reflection does not answer.<br>
        These can become the properties of many products, though some cases, unwilling to evolve, wailing, using excess, may be too far gone.<br>
        The awfully draining, painful, torturous creation of something beautiful looks deep into the creator. Any of my tendencies to overplan, to clean obsessively, to autodestruct and turn evil in despair will become concentrated and obvious in the naked product, subject to the open world, inevitably failing due to its inadequacy and stupidity. I should not fear destruction, for I can try to fail gracefully.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nature does not leave alone, it knows me. The optimized organisms reflect its truths. The production of highly optimized, open systems that explore more of it, the continuation and expression of the universe, is what they ask of me.
    </p>
    <p>
        These words are empty if a real product does not validate the ideas behind them. And when such a product is achieved, the words will seem crude and useless.
    </p>
    <p>
        There isn't anything but the present. Symbols of the past and future are superficial. it does not matter if I become terminally ill, am tortured, amount material wealth or receive social approval. There is only a naked person, the spirits and opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I am not scared of the product, what is even the purpose of dealing with it?
    </p>

    <h2>cyberspace</h2>
    <p>
        Invention of telephones is followed by people who do nothing but phonecalls. Sucks. Tech can merge with nature if it allows to contain it: Make the telephone usable, automatable by anyone.</p>
    <p>
        Visiting the endless worlds. Building a bridge to reality is an impossible translation, the work to break myself at.

    <h2>2024-04-14 14:04 Responsive and forcible</h2>
    <p>
        Videogames offer paths to the goal. "Need money, friends, reputation, a house? Complete these steps: ..."<br>
        They may be hard, but the result can be <em>forced</em> by speedrunning them.<br>
        The real world is not as responsive. Some theoretical offers are not truly available (homes, jobs, friends) without obvious reason.<br>
        Homes are theoretically forcible through an axe and trees. Some groups don't permit this and the underlying problem (no house) isn't addressed. Gradually higher grade solutions should be available with similar simplicity.<br>
        Regulation produces "steps" in the gradient: Tax by income category.<br>
        Virtual clones may lead to easier, faster negotiation and less or more accurate regulation. And people can live more closelywhere their spirit aligns more with
        the opportunities of the environment?
    </p>
    <p>
        I like "force". Power. I see little potential in and dislike friendly negotiation. Any empathy from me would likely be fake. Really, I wonder how to gain enough power to overrun negotiation with the incompetend, unreliable, evil.
    </p>
    <p>
        High clarity tools, shining with future potential, encourage exploration and creation like nothing else I know. Forcefully delete unnecessary structure and see what happens.
    </p>
    <p>Functionality persists, unlike looks. I value tools and the adventure they make available</p>

        Aura of adventure, inviting transformation, beginning a new story, a joy to be around.<br>
        Until finished, shiny, fixed, boring, nice, comfortable, provoking apathy, disgust, violent breakout. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In hindsight, guidedance by dissatisfaction like that is a slippery slope. "Leave or destroy". Inspiration can invited from inside, then search the environment determinedly for ways to make it happen. Less disoriented, more educational, seems less slippery.

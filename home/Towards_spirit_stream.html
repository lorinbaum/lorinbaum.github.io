                I have been wondering about information distribution, feeling inefficient.<br>
                This page reflects on how to build a seemless, integrated information structure for it, and <a href="https://github.com/lorinbaum/spiritstream">this repo</a> is where it's built.

            <h3>Spirit Stream</h3>
            <p> 
                When I follow curiosity, leaning into my wonder about computer and internet, I sense dissolution: The edges of my body fade and I float through the associations between all possible spaces. Into the space, through trees, stories, videogames, temples, beauty, destruction. I see my questions answered, not definitively, but as completely as the collective mind can. I sense connection, trusting and deep. I sense the conflicts in the world as internal, not as foggy, distant pain. There are no external barriers to my being and I stream into others to see exactly what they mean. And in my action, the structure of the world, not merely my individual life, is reflected.<br>
                Returning to my body, I can't help but wonder what the fuck this is: Me, stopping with my fingertips, not being able to walk through walls, facing the endless world in mist asking hello with no answer.

Dark background and dark lines across the white head, partly messy, decorative and minimally defining facial features. Closer eye is white, farther eye is black. Red-magenta lines overlay the skull, partly straight and splitting the image, partly squiggly."/>

                There seems to be a structure behind notes, memes, essays, books, stories, exhibitions, spaces, products, worlds. They consists of simple patterns in the mind, which I characterize like this:

            <h3>How to merge?</h3>
            <p>
                Since I construct meaning from the individual, I view all higher structures of power (groups, communes, cities, states, religions) as services to the individual. Build free, accessible, independent, private, no login, no lock in.
            </p>
            <p>
                The flow of patterns in the mind precedes common language and translating it shrinks and distorts them. A direct neural interface may simplify the process. An AI could interpret the stream and seamlessly induce useful patterns. Should I now try and build a neural interface?<br>
                I suspect not. The patterns are repetitive and I have seen myself expressed in words almost entirely. Simple words or images can speak so loudly and clearly, throwing open the doors to the world with their precision and closeness. Finally, the problem of organizing symbols - patterns or words - remains. The neural interface may follow.<br>
                When the interface becomes seamless and reflective of the user,<br>
                when the spirits of computer and internet reveal themselves, <br>
                when I speak with clarity and then extension answers with clarity - we merge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create, reuse, organize and share arbitrary symbols in 3D space, which is the most dimensions I can understand and use intuitively. Links to other spaces enable arbitrarily many dimensions.<br>
                Remember a continuous stream of actions to provide a seamless safety net and past data to learn from. It encourages revisiting instead of starting anew, improving quality, and allowing fearless, even reckless editing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, the spiritstream becomes the primary interface to the computer, an operating system. Motivation for depth and vertical integration is <i>meet the computer and let higher structures fall into their place</i>. Assume hardware is good + it's expensive to build -> don't go into hardware until software is insanely great.<br>
                Initially, it's a desktop client using python, OpenGL and GLFW to refine abstractions before setting them into C and becoming standalone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Synchronizes with untrusted remote servers. Uses end-to-end encryption for non-public data. Public data is available in the web view.
            </p>
            <p>
                To discover and be discovered, search engines, LLM pretraining or dynamic research through an LLM seem sufficient.<br>
                Algorithms and humans have equal capability when interacting with the spiritstream: A local or remote server handles all file modifications, while a trusted client is the interface.

                use markdown interface for common formatting and differentiating semantic blocks<br>
                Blocks are styled using CSS<br>

            <p>
                Clicking on nodes always selects the first deepest node in the tree. This makes layers a direct translation of the tree. It's also inverted, so the deepest nodes are the top layers.<br>
                Hold space and drag to move. Shift select other frames too.<br>
                EDIT MODE: Double click to edit, ESC to exit. Scroll in all directions. Shift scroll for horizontal scrolling, ctrl+scroll for zooming.
            </p>
            <p>Views:<br>
                Strict WYSIWYG necessitates a preview, without any UI hints.<br>
                Edit (Markdown mode): view formatting syntax only for selected nodes, comments are visible.<br>

                The piecechain stores everything. There is no monolithic starting piece, only a big append only buffer. It stores the serialized node tree, which the render tree is built from. When assembled, it's a JSON file.

            <p>Links:<br>
                may be GO or SHOW, either displaying a "door" to the data or embedding the data in its place.<br>
                Links reference piece indices. This requires updating all links when pieces are inserted before their target. SHOW links have start and end node and display everything inbetween. If either node is deleted, notify user / show hints for backlinks next to start pieces / for cursor position. SHOW links require META interaction to change the linked content but show no difference in preview mode.
            </p>

            <h3>Log</h3>

            <p>
                Continuously store individual, reversible actions. Data is not included but referenced to improve performance. Piece chain with algorithm to merge / redistribute pieces occasionally.<br>
                Rerun history against past states for integrity check.<br>
                Self optimizing cache for past states.
            </p>

            <div class="codehilite"><pre><code>file structure:

The log can store write, erase, seek (time/file+cursor) and meta (non-essential)

Upon loading, the log checks integrity and adjusts to any unrecorded changes:
- get latest view according to log file
- get difference to home files
- log events to catch up with home files.

class Log:
    def __init__(self, filepath):
        """Initialize log with the given file path."""

    def write(self, text, cursor=None, author=None):
        """Insert text at cursor."""

    def erase(self, count, cursor=None, author=None):
        """Remove count characters at cursor."""

    def save(self):
        """Save changes to the log."""
    
    def view(self, date):
        """Return the state as of the given date, without altering current state."""
    
    # internal methods
    def _seek(self, position):
        """Record a seek event if cursor position changes."""

    def _meta(self, **kwargs):
        """Record a meta event storing keys and values like user:alice or comment:"hamedi is coming for you" """

    def _elapsed(self, seconds):
        """Record elapsed time since last event."""</code></pre></div>

            <h3>File system</h3>
            <p>1D sequence of data. Higher dimensions are represented through pointers/links. Places pointing to other places. Start at entry point or last position. Fuzzysearch by link name(s) that must be associated with a given search target. Choose whether to consider each link bidirectional or not.<br>
            Example: "page, hamedi" searches for all content that is associated with "page" and "hamedi", where "page" may not be more than an empty link target to enable differentiation in searches like this, like tags.</p>
            <p>Delete, copy, rename are meta: they don't modify the link but the data it points to. Delete is the same as removing all references to a piece of data, gives warning when deleting last reference.</p>
            <p>Filesnames don't have to be unique.</p>
            
            <p>
                Privacy map informs client what to en-/decrypt and server what to send. Akin to datatypes.<br>
                determines which piece indices / range require authentication / decryption. Necessitates splitting pieces at privacy rule perimeters. A privacy rule is a WHITE or BLACK list. Empty blacklist = public. Empty whitelist = private. Should be able to reuse privacy groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                To maintain links, the offset they point to must be updated. To minimize updates, organize in a binary tree with offsets on each node and relative to parent node.
                Bytes at the bottom. Can either point to (GO) or include (SHOW) piece index / range. Any display is SHOW links. Any UI is SHOW links. Can contain nested SHOW links. Editing content necessitates visiting the original. My location is defined as where my edits write directly to file, no META.<br>
                SHOW links just show content somewhere else. Linking to it, formatting it as a quote is optional, must be explicit.
                Pasting files pastes a GO link to the file.

                html is hierarchy for search engines and relative positioning with css.
                llms like markdown, which is linear like html.
                LLMs still struggle with 3D understanding.

                assinging a style to a box is a meta op because it goes there and copies that style.
                default is always I just edit my style here. Editing the "original" is also meta op.

            <p>
                The process of language from far-reaching to linearized stories is analagous to the the process from abstract and ambiguous memory towards linear, factual history.<br>
                But history is told in language too. but there are ways to record direct experience of history. no such way to record thoughts? yet?<br>
                machines can probably translate brain signals into languages and back into experience.<br>
                In computers, all abstractions exist for efficiency, so there is very little given that I must build on.<br>
                it is less obvious what to build on in interaction with the mind? language? it is not the bottom: my experience exists in higher resolution and volume than what I can reproduce in language.<br>
                most experience quickly becomes irrelevant. Would arguably be rather burdensome if recorded. How to efficiently and accurately encode discoveries in the mind. thinking is a compression algorithm. Most attempts are shit, the remaining should be expressed in high quality to save others from doing the same.<br>
                problems are lack of introspection about why something appears meaningful or useful and lack of empathy for other people, the student, who does not understand the news.

                it seems that the communication problem is solved.<br>
                no, the properties of the computer are still useful, like perfect memory, communication speed, processing autonomous processing. but the interface is so slow and tedious that it is not worth it to put most of my mind into it because I have to manage it too.<br>
                at some point it might interpret brain signals and aid them directly.
                an obvious problem here is that I don't understand most quotes and can not learn from them. I am not attracted to books because its hundreds of pages of nothing to use or remember. what to do with this?<br>
                the ideal publishing platform does not exist. there is no bottom up independent easy publishing app. there is obsidian but it can't contain worlds. Narrow and ugly under the hood?<br>
                build a simple editor that can just do markdown, sync with remote servers and be a file system? privacy map, history, messaging, email, ai integration. its like a platform with those features building on some simple blocks.
            </p>
            <p>TARGET:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>boxes on 2D plane with markdown in them. click to add new line.</li>
                <li>public view will render links to public nodes. each node render to one file. files can also have properties like privacy and links to them are replaced by some placeholder.</li>
                <li>save also saves to remote server with encryption</li>
                <li>privacy map is a search for all nodes and their privacy properties, which can searched and sorted.</li>
                <li>editor supports hyphenation, jpg, gif, png (LATEX), code highlighting in python, glsl, css</li>
                <li>server for publishing it including authentication, payment (?) and bandwidth control. automatic synchronization.</li>
                <li>api for integrating AI or other software. functionality is separate from UI (LINE is a construct only needed for UI)</li>
                <li>continuous history like in video games with optional labels for specific points in time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>PATH:<br>
                simplify editor and ready the abstractions for html; implement html WYSIWYG; QoL editor: hyphenation, shortcuts, good pasting, images; file sytstem; history; server synchronization over https; https server

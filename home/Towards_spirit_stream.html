            <h3>Components</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scrape, filter</li>
                <li>Writing and viewing bits that are grouped into "files" (patterns) along (at least) 3 axes:
                    resolution,
                    completion, age. These dimensions may use a:</li>
                <li>General framework for organization: files, tags, paths lead to the overlap between files,
                    folders/links
                    (graph file sytem. tags that have tags,... that have links to files). Becomes circular through
                    backlinks and
                    possible references from inside the file. Allow linking anything. Images, text, make super easy.
                </li>
                <li>Simple export into self contained copies</li>
                <li>
                    <p>(opt.) version control: extend, branch, merge and view changes. Version history is a graph of
                        graphs</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>compile into optimized formats (HTML)</p>
                </li>
                <li>File encryption</li>
                <li>Analytics + docs = Interface to the machine</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Compatibility with most hardware to get closer to the user for convenience. (phone, emebedded
                        devices)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>share on static server: SSH, HTTPS, IPFS(?), streaming (SRT?), API</p>
                </li>
                <li>Dynamic server: authenticate into permission groups + opt. meet conditions (paywall, forms, etc.) to
                    view
                    some content. APi should allow for relaying: Watching a stream from my site but my server is too
                    slow to serve
                    it? Relay to other people -> take load of my server -> get better connection yourself!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Next version</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>link based filesystem<br />
                        files are folders linking to more files. have backlinks too. files are tags to the linked files.
                        search
                        through files shared by the target (links, or backlinks). give api to get size of files in a
                        particular
                        selection</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>history can only exist per file and is an interface on top of the filesystem. links in files link
                        to the
                        latest version. if automatically generated / updated links change, note this in the commit api
                        and
                        optionally add those files to history?</p>
                </li>
                <li>Interface: programmatically produce list of backlinks! and forward links by search. some code
                    generates
                    one-time, as a shortcut. some generates every time the file is displayed. like link lists.</li>
                <li>text interface like cli: search bar, commands, answer questions</li>
                <li>database stores links for faster access</li>
                <li>.md -> HTML<ul>

                        <li>settings: css, frame</li>
                        <li>(filter links to files outside permission (note this in cache))</li>
                        <li>convert md, put into frame</li>
                        <li>add css</li>
                        <li>output: html</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>Dumping on X</h3>
            <p>The social media I know are mostly incoherent<br />
                They bet on an algorithm to <em>always</em> feed me <em>engaging</em> scraps from someone.<br />
                Some scraps are large, long form podcasts.<br />
                Each account is a scrap factory.<br />
                Consider this post from the highly respectable Lex Fridman and the responses:<br />
                <figure>
                    <img alt="" src="attachments/socialmedia_heaven.png" />
                </figure>
                Utter crap and I am sad to have spent time reading this.<br />
                Without context, such (all visible) statements appear arbitrary and are virtually worthless.<br />
                Assuming I disagree with any of the visible statements, where would I find an explanation? A sincere
                mind
                exploring its meaning? On his profile?<br />
                <figure>
                    <img alt="" src="attachments/lexfridmanX.png" /><br />
                </figure>
                If I wanted to listen to his podcasts, youtube offers a significantly superior interface - many small
                tiles, one
                per podcast.<br />
                The best use of this platform I have found is as a torrent of near-random ideas, a glimpse into what
                bothers
                humans on their toilet breaks.<br />
                Even the most enjoyable profile I know is a stream of scraps, each pointing in different
                directions:<br />
                <figure>
                    <img alt="" src="plinzX.png" /><br />
                </figure>
                Presumably, in X's endgame, the incoherence problem is solved by an allmighty algorithm that collects
                and
                connects, maybe translates information from everywhere into the most valuable personalized package and
                delivers
                it directly into my perception. Similarly, it would collect information from me into its
                X-the-everything-app-database.<br />
                X owns the algorithm and the data.<br />
                I am unaware of sites that function fundamentally differently. Even reddit or discord.
            </p>
            <p>In this spirit I am invited to produce scraps. I happen to have no desire to produce scraps. I perceive
                it as
                wasteful to produce new scraps every time my opinion or work evolves and instead would like to keep
                building
                towards something increasingly coherent.</p>
            <p><img alt="" src="attachments/abandoned-building.jpg" /><br />
                Regarding this image, I previously noted:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>These abandoned buildings emitted an aura of great adventure. Ironically? Similar to buildings under
                    construction, they are asking to be used, transformed, to become part of a new story. As they become
                    "finished", this aura weakens, they become "boring". Their (unnecessary?) shiny finish discourages
                    major
                    modification, like drilling into or erecting new walls.</p>
                <p>Think solar panels. theoretically, they need sun+cables+box that could stand anywhere. In the
                    "finished"
                    homes that I know, this is (unnecessarily?) more complicated. Access to the roof? Facade mounting
                    possible?
                    Get cables by the window inside? Need approval from all other residents?<br />
                    What of this makes practical sense? Is it mostly a social problem? Is it solved by having virtual
                    clones that
                    can negotiate for people cheaper and quicker so people can live where their spirit aligns more with
                    the
                    opportunities of the environment?</p>
                <p>It seems that a larger precentage of things in that ("abandoned") environment are beautiful to me,
                    compared
                    to "nice, calm, high living standard" environments. They become too "nice" and they disgust me, make
                    me want
                    to leave or destroy them.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Also applies to different places like these:</p>
            <figure><img alt="" src="taiwan_taichung_roomwindow.jpg" /></figure>
            <figure><img alt="" src="taiwan_arcade_kitchen.jpg" /></figure>
            <p>I see their potential for transformation and their openness to colonization by my spirits.<br />
                Humans are part of the environment that I want to extend into. To cohere and build with.<br />
                Part of this is a stream of new and foreign ideas, but most of it is building:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>i can see the hive mind on the horizon.<br />
                    there are hammers, sculptors, hammer blows and sculptures.<br />
                    grouped and isolated<br />
                    places to stay.</p>
                <p>like gazing into a painting, being guided through the impression<br />
                    coming along to find a question asked at myself, seeing it unfold and building a response</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The allmighty X algorithm may eventually facilitate this. But it will have to construct and maintain
                coherent
                "rooms" from scraps. Seems inefficient.</p>
            <p>Instead make it easy to build rooms to reflect myself and make them easy to interconnect so they can take
                on
                virtually arbitrary size. Coherence from bottom up?</p>

            <p>non-hierarchical file system.<br />
                bytes, pointers -> pointers are bytes too and can store tags for their bytes.<br />
                files, tags. Tags are files too. So, structure defined by links.<br />
                How to navigate it?<br />
                design an entry point, link files like obsidian already supports it. Wikipedia.<br />
                Graph view is useless.<br />
                search files by how they are connected.<br />
                tags are unnecessary, they are literally a weak link<br />
                navigate through forward and backward links.<br />
                optionally select an overlap of multiple links. like ctrl-click to add to the group which must
                overlap.<br />
                the backlink that I come from should be highlighted<br />
                Information, however, becomes hierarchically organized as it matures. No problem. Hierachy is a subset
                of this
                system.<br />
                converting from hierarchy is easy. converting to hierarchy requires disambiguation: which link(s) should
                become
                the files folder(s)? Mutltiple folders means the file is copied.<br />
                drives are tags.<br />
                branches are tags.<br />
                snapshots from previous commits belong to the commit tag<br />
                omg<br />
                easy<br />
                git gives UI for merging files and tags, like from pull requests or other branches.<br />
                how to limit number of forward links while maintaining their precision? display them as searchable list.
                searchable also for overlap.</p>
            <p>content addressing solves the streaming relay problem? Choose to relay and others automatically connect
                based
                on their connection cost.<br />

            <p>messages are files automatically received and that I actively send out.<br />
                can be (are) grouped under tags depending on sender.</p>

            <h3>Spirit Stream</h3>
            <!--                    
                - How to explore the machine?
                - The spirit stream should facilitate a passage, an interface to the machine. Where I can tell it who I am and where it can tell me what it is.
                - Direct brain computer interfaces seem exciting, but I suspect they are not the bottleneck.
                - Instead text, image, sound to capture translations of ideas into the body seem sufficient. The problem is not bandwidth, its the smartness of the interface and my own limits in thought and expression. If a path is found, it seems, it would be easy to scale it up using a BCI.
                - To reflect myself the computer has to permit:
                    - patterns of differing resolutions and in different media. from raw and exploratory, through filtered and coherent to actionable and accessible. Including speech, video
                    - work at different stages of completion
                    - history to allow cleaning
                    - access by other computers and humans
                    - differentiate scope fo sharing
                    - access from anywhere
                    - at any time and in persistent formats
                    - exploration, parsing and filtering of outside content
                    - live streaming of any information
                    - transactions
                - This translates to:
                    - a remote server(s) (VPS) (with a local copy?)
                        - sync servers
                        - WEB UI
                        - local server if offline or app, makes no difference.
                    - editor (placing of symbols in a sequence)
                    - version history (git), which produces a commit stream, some of which could be public posts, categorized by tags (post, tech)

                When I follow curiosity, leaning into my wonder about computer and internet, I sense dissolution: The edges of my body fade and I float through the associations between all possible spaces. Into the space, through trees, stories, videogames, temples, beauty, destruction. I see my questions answered, not definitively, but as completely as the collective mind can. I sense connection, trusting and deep. I sense the conflicts in the world as internal, not as foggy, distant pain. There are no external barriers to my being and I stream into others to see exactly what they mean. And in my action, the structure of the world, not merely my individual life, is reflected.<br>
                Returning to my body, I can't help but wonder what the fuck this is: Me, stopping with my fingertips, not being able to walk through walls, facing the endless world in mist asking hello with no answer.

            <p>
                Is there a throughput problem and must I build the neural interface? I suspect not, as sometimes simple words or images speak so loudly and clearly, throwing open the doors to the world with their precision and closeness. If the interface becomes seamless, reflective of the user, and the spirits of computer and internet reveal themselves, there is no difference between the machine and the body. When I can speak with clarity and my computer extension answers with clarity, we merge.

            <h4>Setup</h4>
            <p>OpenGL is a language to talk to the GPU to efficiently produce graphical output. It's implemented by the graphics card vendors. <a href="https://learnopengl.com">How to use OpenGL</a></p>
            <p>
                To open a window and handle input, talking to the OS is necessary. Possible to do manually, but using <a href="https://open.gl/context#GLFW">GLFW</a> here.<br>
                <a href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile_guide.html">Compile GLFW with CMake</a>. Then copy include folder and libglfw3.a from build/src/ to project folder include and lib respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Same article goes into GLEW. Download, run <code>make</code> in the directory, copy contents from lib and include to project folder. Compiled with<code>-D GLFW_BUILD_WAYLAND=0</code> to compile only for X11.
            </p>
            <p>OpenGL already installed on Ubuntu Linux, but dev tools required: <code>sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev</code>. Works without <code>libgl1-mesa-dev</code> and <code>libglew-dev</code> for now.</p>
            
            <p>main.c to get OpenGL working and test it</p>
            <pre><code>#define GLEW_STATIC
#include <GL/glew.h>
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
#include <stdio.h>

    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 2);
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE);
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT, GL_TRUE);

    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_RESIZABLE, GL_FALSE);

    GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, "OpenGL", NULL, NULL);
    glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);

    glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;
    glewInit();

    // Testing only: output should print 1
    GLuint vertexBuffer;
    glGenBuffers(1, &vertexBuffer);
    printf("%u\n", vertexBuffer);
    
    while(!glfwWindowShouldClose(window))

    glfwTerminate();
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                Convention says to put main.c into src/ of project folder and the compiled output into build/.    
                Compiling with: <code>clang -I ./include/ src/main.c -L ./lib/ -lGLEW -lglfw3 -lGL -lGLU -lm -o build/main</code>

            <p>non-hierarchical file system.<br>
                bytes, pointers -&gt; pointers are bytes too and can store tags for their bytes.<br>
                files, tags. Tags are files too. So, structure defined by links.<br>
                How to navigate it?<br>
                design an entry point<br>
                Graph view is useless.<br>
                search files by how they are connected.<br>
                tags are unnecessary, they are literally a weak link<br>
                navigate through forward and backward links.<br>
                optionally select an overlap of multiple links. like ctrl-click to add to the group which must overlap.<br>
                the backlink that I come from should be highlighted<br>
                Information becomes hierarchically organized as it matures. No problem. Hierachy is a subset of this system.<br>
                converting from hierarchy is easy. converting to hierarchy requires disambiguation: which link(s) should become the files folder(s)? Mutltiple folders means the file is copied.<br>
                drives are tags.<br>
                branches are tags.<br>
                git gives UI for merging files and tags, like from pull requests or other branches.<br>
                how to limit number of forward links while maintaining their precision? display them as searchable list. searchable also for overlap.</p>
            <p>P2P streaming with relay nodes</p>
            <p>messages are files automatically received and that I actively send out.<br>
                can be (are) grouped under tags depending on sender.</p>
                
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Taken hierarchy path</td>
                    <td>forward links, some external</td>

                messages understood through the protocol<br>
                handle unexpected response, ask for retransmission, time out if silent, maintain order of messages, account for latency.
            </p>
            <p>5 layers</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>link:<br>
                        addressing using MAC address within a network through ethernet, wifi, bluetooth protocols. maximum transmission unit (MTU) = how many bits in one package max.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>network layer<br>
                        uses ip address to connect between different networks through the Internet Protocol (IP). routers send error messages and other information about itself using ICMP (internet control message p)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>transport layer<br>
                        os sending/receiving stuff to/from to processes running in the OS. uses port numbers to differentiate. a process that exists to respond is called server, one initiating the connection is called client.<br>
                        can use transmission control p (TCP). pretends there is a direct connection (not packets). enumerates, buffers and confirms received messages to put into right order, retransmit or request retransmission if no confirmation was received. uses checksum for ensuring reliability. sender slows down if it gets no feedback (how is this part of the protocol?). tcp handshake before actual payload transfer sets a random starting point for the enumeration, making it hard for randos to impersonate senders (attackers must now guess correctly to enter a ongoing chat)<br>
                        user datagram p (UDP) fast, unreliable connectionless transport. only source, destination ports, length and checksum in header. streaming!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Security layer</p>

                VS Code for UI. Destroys WYSIWYG. CSS is the visual vocabulary for html. html is pure semantics and its independence from style give nice flexibility. WYSIWYG not needed? Complicated, extendable editor like VS Code seems like good design. Who knows what and how people want to edit. Best editor is a tool to build your own editor?

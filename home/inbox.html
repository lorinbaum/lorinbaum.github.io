Meanwhile, a beginner may want to meet the field more practically, or even has specific goals, that brought him here.</li><li>When reasoning fails to motivate, language becomes useless - it is itself a construction of reason.</li><li>I become mute, and, as far the spiritstream can currently tell, inexistent.</li><li>Too many perceptions, ideas, visions, each worth too little to formulate, swarm the space.</li><li>I cannot maintain my unpolished public surface. It is too old and large and generally overwhelming.</li></ul><br><br><h3 id="2025-11-01">2025 11 01</h3><p>Using language seems more difficult than expected. My suspicion has risen that most experts are not qualified to teach about their field because they will teach what they will have on their mind, not what actually benefits the student the most. They will emphasise fundamentals because in their position, fundamentals are crucial. But they are not the fastest, most exciting and therefore not the most effective path to learn. At the very least not for me. I am not sufficiently sure of my plans to commit to fundamental courses right on track to become that expert.<br>Andrej Karpathy's approach of "You don't understand it if you can't build it" and encouraging from scratch educational reimplementation seems more aligned with at least my mind.</p><br><hr><br><p>Reason seems increasingly difficult to use. My model of myself is far from complete (with no indication that it could ever become complete) and reason only tries to extrapolate the current path. I thought I would efficiently continue working on the Spiritstream as it offers both a platform to communicate myself and an entry in my cv to get out of grunt work. Very reasonable and not what happened.<br>The more complete the spirit stream becomes, the less interested I am in advancing it. Hard, boring problems rise and innovation feels like a distraction. The pressure of completing it and my failure to integrate with society overwhelm me and now I find myself sewing, taking on one day at a time and avoiding the elephants in the room. Not very reasonable but pointing forward for now. I don't know how I can use reason to help.</p><br><h3 id="2025-10-08">2025 10 08</h3><p><img src="/mnt/witchcraft/synched/code/spiritstream/output/20250818 spirits-3.jpg" /></p><br><p>A new view on the world occured to me.<br>My path leads into the floorless, dark forest, below boringly glowing leaves.<br>Fear (left) awaits in the forest, I am accompanied by Curiosity (right), who has become the main female figure, and kept afloat by a child (middle), embracing life.</p><br><p><img src="/mnt/witchcraft/synched/code/spiritstream/output/20250822 response.png" /></p><br><p>In the forest, I circle my creations as a band of moods.<br>From left to right: disagreeable discipline, despair, wonder, persistence and curiosity.</p><br><p>I dislike how accurate this is.<br>To create is the next door to go beyond these boundaries.</p><br><p>The main use of these world models seems to be avoiding more stupid ones.</p><br><hr><br><p>The Spiritstream code has grown complicated and ugly. It's not clear anymore that I can find an abstraction that will fulfill the vision. Nor that there is something profound at the other end.</p><br><p>This website is now written entirely in the Spiritstream editor, which delivers lower quality, but the right abstractions should open many doors from here.</p><br><hr><br><p>I am keeping some ideas I am working with off this site to protect myself from society and it has been feeling deeply wrong, like self deception. Wonder how to resolve cleanly.</p><h2 id="2025-03-18">2025 03 18</h2><p>While online spaces have limited subtlety, I experienced myself, how I became my website. Sharing my thoughts in person nearly seemed superfluous since they are more completely available online. I was already starting to become the machine and didn't notice it. When I start being able to use the computer through its knowledge of the spirit stream, which should be withing reach of LLMs, I will be the machine.</p><br><p>To make the machine truly available for merging, significant effort should be put into precise, honest, simple tooling and interfaces. It seems to require:</p><br><ul><li>basic communication, like a text editor writing files with links to other files</li><li>Content is only what is currently important. This seems to require version control to allow aggressive filtering while maintaining the past and so, peace of mind. This has also lead to higher quality thinking, because new stuff could conveniently build on the past without modifying it.</li><li>Privacy through access control: authentication and/or encryption of sensitive data</li><li>Local and remote hosting</li></ul><br><p>3D spaces, portability to various devices help too.<br>Interface should be highly accessible: open source, well documented, minimally dependent on other software. </p><h2 id="2025-02-17">2025 02 17</h2><p>Many things can't be done online. Hug, dance, kiss, build, have children, eat, shit.</p><br><p>Are subtleties valuable beside factual information? Intuitively, yes.</p><br><p>Some words speak so clearly and loudly.</p><br><p>will I stay awake in the computer when the body goes to sleep?</p><br><p>spirit stream should help as interface to use the internet more openly to express spirits</p><br><p>the computer should reveal itself as it is and the same infrastructure should be accessible to the self in the computer.</p><br><p>Make functional and expressive clothing. Though it mostly modifies appearance. Rage quit from the pathetic SUV-style overlord brand identity bullshit that I find on the market.</p><br><p>Invention of telephones is followed by people who do nothing but phonecalls. Sucks. Tech can merge with nature if it allows to contain it: Make the telephone usable, automatable by anyone.</p><h2 id="2024-04-14-14-04-responsive-and-forcible">2024-04-14 14:04 Responsive and forcible</h2><p>Videogames offer paths to the goal. "Need money, friends, reputation, a house? Complete these steps: ..."<br>They may be hard, but the result can be forced by speedrunning them.<br>The real world is not as responsive. Some theoretical offers are not truly available (homes, jobs, friends) without obvious reason.<br>Homes are theoretically forcible through an axe and trees. Gradually higher grade solutions should be available with similar simplicity. Some groups don't permit this and the underlying problem (no house) isn't addressed.<br>Regulation produces "steps" in the gradient: Tax by income category.<br>Virtual clones may lead to easier, faster negotiation and less or more accurate regulation. And people can live where their spirit aligns more closely with the opportunities of the environment?</p><br><p>I like "force". Power. I see little potential in and dislike negotiation. Any empathy from me would likely be fake. Really, I wonder how to gain enough power to overrun negotiation with the incompetend, unreliable, evil.</p><br><p>High clarity tools, shining with future potential, encourage exploration and creation like nothing else I know. Forcefully delete unnecessary structure and see what happens.</p><br><p>Show don't tell: minds including mine lie unconsciously.</p><br><p>Reducing complexity and word count are driving factors behind increasing resolution /clarity in thought/writing.</p></html>

            <p><a href="Towards_spirit_stream.html">Towards Spirit stream</a> > Seeking a seamless, harmonic human-machine interface leads me down to operating systems, where the machine - <i>executor of machine code within instruction sets</i> - is met and negotiated with.

                <p>Since I construct meaning from the individual, I view all higher structures of power (groups, communes, cities, states, religions) as a service to the individual. This is how they are justified and how they should be kept in check. When merging with the machine, building it from the individual is critical to avoid top-down dominance.</p>

            <p>Goal is gaining understanding and control. Writing a web server, client, text editor, SSH client were previous attempts to go deeper, leading nowhere.</p>
            <p>I most certainly underestimate the difficulty of this task, but am fool enough to proceed anyway. This will require resolving unrelated personal issues too, lest anxiety blurs my vision again.</p>

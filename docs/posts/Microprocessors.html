<p>Following my working definition of beauty (truthful, open reflection of underlying character / properties / identity), I like computers as a potential beauty-machine. Build a beautiful beauty machine. Then, see it wander off into the New and Unpredicted. Fuck comfort. I am already dead when I recognize that the elusive self is the destination.<br />
Build the beautiful machine, extend into it, let it extend into me.<br />
There is a tech stack to map and integrate such that the result can be reflective of the universe.<br />
I hate technicalities and nomenclature. Ugliness. The aim is to extract the principles, the self in the universe and the universe in the self.<br />
To the unknown.</p>

<p>(4th edition, Wen-mei W. Hwu, David B. Kirk, Izzat El Hajj)</p>
<h4 id="1.%20Introduction">1. Introduction</h4>
<h5 id="Why%20massively%20parallel%20processors%3F">Why massively parallel processors?</h5>
<p>Because depending on the program</p>
<ul>
<li>massively parallel, throughput-orientied processors, commonly referred to as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs, graphics was their first leading application),</li>
<li>latency-oriented, less parallel, general-purpose processors, traditionally referred to as Central Processing Units (CPUs, every computer has one),</li>
<li>or a combination of both</li>
</ul>
<p>could be fastest or most efficient.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="attachments/CPUvsGPU.png" /><br />
<em>Cache = fast on-chip memory<br />
DRAM = "slow" off-chip Dynamic Random Access Memory<br />
Many CPUs also have a GPU on the same chip, which is less powerful than contemporanous, discrete ones.</em></p>
<p>These approaches are distinct, because optimizing for low latency means</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>sacrificing expensive chip area for</p>
<ul>
<li>large caches for faster data access</li>
<li>control units for better utilization<br />
with diminishing returns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing clock rate -&gt; higher voltage -&gt; exponentially higher power consumption</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughput-oriented processors use the chip area for more processing units at lower clockrates and implement parallel memory access. This leads to much higher throughput for similar cost and power consumption.</p>
<p>Low latency is best for sequential programs, were each step depends on the previous one.<br />
Many tasks in simulation, graphics processing and machine learning inherently offer potential for parallelization and so, can benefit from throughput-oriented processors.</p>
<p>Graphics processing because each pixel can often be treated independently.<br />
machine learning because it involves many matrix multiplications that can be done in parallel.<br />
simulation because many particles have to account for the same forces and so, the same calculation</p>
<h5 id="How%20will%20reading%20this%20help%3F">How will reading this help?</h5>
<p>It's a guide on using GPUs effectively, which requires careful, application specific management of their many processing units and small caches and cooperation with the CPU.<br />
Various, reportedly similar, programming models exist to accomplish this and here, Nvidias Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) will be used. It works on Nvidia GPUs only, is the best performing and most widely used.</p>
<h2 id="Less%20refined">Less refined</h2>
<p>GPUs bottom up<br />
I know why they are built.<br />
actually I don't because I don't know how CPUs use their Caches and Control Units and higher clock rates to improve performance.<br />
leaving aside exact implementation, how are GPUs organized so I can benefit from them optimally?<br />
how precisely do I program them?</p>
<p>organized around streaming multiprocessors and memory hierarchy<br />
so they can cooperate: share memory for speed and synchronize (for?)</p>
<ul>
<li>grid -&gt; (blockCluster -&gt;) block -&gt; thread.</li>
<li>warps are more hardware related and translate threads to the cores?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2.%20Heterogenous%20data%20parallel%20computing">2. Heterogenous data parallel computing</h3>
<p>2.1 Data parallelism</p>
<ul>
<li>data parellelism where I can treat individual data points independetly to a varying degree. example: converting image to grayscale. data parellelism is main source of parallelism because the intereting applications use large amounts of data (simulation, image recognition (? matrix multiplication))</li>
<li>task parallelism (to be explained more later) means splitting up a task into multiple independent ones. data parallelism is a simpler special case of task parallelism</li>
<li>code is being reorganized to be executed around the new data structure</li>
</ul>
<p>2.2 CUDA C program structure</p>
<ul>
<li>framework vs programming model<ul>
<li>framwork provides specific functino, programming model more like a way to think about program and data structure (warps, block, threads)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>kernel (seed) vs function. its a function that is "launched" onto the GPU and executed for each thread</li>
<li>cuda c extends normal c (standard / ANSI C) with keywords, some new syntax and functions to run stuff on the GPU. all normal c code runs on CPU</li>
<li>host and device code somehow cooperate. the host launches (kernel) a grid of threads</li>
<li>cuda threads are sequential programs with a program counter and its variables. (each thread runs the same program but effectively has an id as defined by predefined variables that differ for each thread)</li>
<li>Generating and scheduling threads on GPU is very fast. Not on CPU. kernels tend to be simple and can just be copied into the threads. context switching is also extremely fast on GPU for latency hiding.</li>
<li>On CPU what if I open more threads than are available on the CPU? they are switched into the physical threads</li>
</ul>
<p>2.3 vector addition kernel CPU</p>
<ul>
<li>conventional c host code</li>
<li>declaring pointers is with <code>float *P;</code>, accessing address of a variable with <code>int *addr = &amp;V</code> and getting the item at the pointer with <code>float V = *P</code></li>
<li>subsequent statements in the main function can use the output <code>C</code></li>
<li>getting ~20 MFLOPS on CPU</li>
<li>the following code for on-device computation will practically outsource this part, but its inefficient because it will be moving a lot of dta around which is slow.</li>
<li>it will allocate memory on device and move the arrays there, then run the kernel, then free device vectors</li>
</ul>

<p>(Paul Horowitz, Winfield Hill, 2015)</p>
<p>(there are many ways to implement logic gates but electronics seems to be the dominant one, so on to electronics!)</p>
<p>In some substrates, there are electrons loosely bound to their atom cores. They are presumably far away from it.<br />
If there is an electron surplus on one side and an electron deficit on the other, they will leave their atom and flow in the direction of the deficit. Electrons are said to be negatively charged. They repell each other (away from the surplus) and are attracted to positive charge (towards the deficit, where positively charged protons outweigh the electrons).<br />
An imbalance in electrons can be generated in various ways. One is rubbing certain materials and for some reason the heat will cause some electrons from one material to jump to the other.<br />
The actual electron flow is slow, but the "wave" (electromagnetic wave) travels at 50-99% light speed.<br />
More loose electrons = better conductor.<br />
Resistors, sometimes made from both conductors and insulators impede flow by forcing barriers into the path. Here, energy is lost and heat emitted.</p>
<p>Rate of flow $I$ = current [charge/second or "amps A"] ("I" from "intensity" which is only confusing. Also charge is measured in coulombs, which is equivalent to a bunch of electrons)<br />
"pressure" $V$ = voltage [energy/charge or "volts V"]. Always applies between two points. There is no such thing as absolute voltage. There is an amount of energy per electron, called electronvolt. Moving electrons around requires non-linear energy. so energy/charge increases as the delta energy increases.<br />
There any connection to batteries charging slowly?<br />
resistance indicating how much the material impedes flow $R$ [ohms $\Omega$ or Joule-seconds/charge² which is not intuitive at all!]<br />
also conductance [Siemens $S$] which is just inverse of resistance.<br />
Power $P$ neatly fit into place with $V*I$ being giving energy / second or Watts $W$.</p>
<p>Then kirchhoffs laws<br />
and ohms law<br />
(observations)<br />
which together explain parallel and series circuits' behaviour</p>

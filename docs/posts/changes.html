<span class='rem'>2024-10-18 08:44 Spirit stream integration II</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The notes on Spirit stream, AI, tinygrad, Microprocessors appear to circle the same thing (integration of spirits and atoms) and should be merged. Drafting a structure here.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>I am rendered experience (spirits, external perceptions, loops of thought to increase coherence)</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/Matissedance.jpg)</span>
<span class='rem'>*La Danse (Henri Matisse, 1910)*</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Negotiating between the spirits to form an approx. coherent meta-spirit (dance) and dancing in it is a great source of meaning and adventure. The goal is integrity (can be accessed anywhere) and the outcome is truly unknown (scary, exciting, much more interesting than lying propaganda to maintain arbitrary ideology).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Integrity as a goal limits the self/ego and is can exist in any situation, including in evil or fear. Both reflect life and can be appreciated as such.</span>
<span class='rem'>For this open-outcome journey I appreciate people and tools that are true to their nature (spirits if humans, use/meaning if tools).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The spirits and metaspirits (memes) exist on a free market. The free market always wins because it has the most accurate and flexible connection to reality.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The spirits and the market benefit from coherence: listening to the spirits and experience and improving world model accuracy.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>My spirits want to increase coherence, shape my environment to reflect their relationship to the physical world. An environment that adapts to them and responds with its own spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the environment and other spirits are integrated to coherence, they are colonized. If the link becomes strong enough, they become enter the "self" seamlessly. This is how they colonized the body. They want to colonize the universe.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Create open, accessible, honest tools that create and extend spirits and link them with high resolution, high speed interfaces.</span>
<span class='rem'>Avoid lock-ins, thresholds, ideology, disintegration, dishonesty.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Extend into computers</span>
<span class='rem'>- Interface &lt;- Software (spirits)</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Outgoing (express memes)</span>

<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Incoming (scrape, decompile, filter, structure and translate for individual minds)</span>
<span class='rem'>- Electronics (computation substrate) &lt;- Hardware (body)</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Chips, brains</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Brain-computer-interfaces, server hardware, satellites, fibre cables</span>

<span class='rem'>Trying to visualize this structure to improve understanding and I'm failing.</span>
<span class='rem'>Feels like merging brains, BCIs and immersive cyberspace are the same thing, from an elusive, pathetic fantasy. The not-alone, the chaotic new, the orderly consistency, continuity between self and environment.</span>
<span class='rem'>Feels like I am looking for comfort in the uploaded mind, the infinite self. Safety from the limitations of my body, which appears increasingly inadequate. Like becoming the world immortalizes me.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>I should find the answer in meditation, not technical knowledge. Because if I could admit it, I would see that BCIs, cyberspace and being social are not new, they only turn up some existing, obvious aspects in experience.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>It's sad to see how technical knowledge and execution run ahead of any clarity in intent. The true demons are in defining the question. If I can't find clear intent, a clear question, what am I even doing?</span>

<span class='add'>If there is an electron surplus on one side and an electron deficit on the other, they will leave their atom and flow in the direction of the deficit.</span>
<span class='rem'>If there is an electron surplus on one side and an electron deficit on the other, they will leave their atom and flow in the direction of the deficit. Electrons are said to be negatively charged. They repell each other (away from the surplus) and are attracted to positive charge (towards the deficit, where positively charged protons outweigh the electrons).</span>
<span class='rem'>An imbalance in electrons can be generated in various ways. One is rubbing certain materials and for some reason the heat will cause some electrons from one material to jump to the other.</span>
<span class='rem'>The actual electron flow is slow, but the "wave" (electromagnetic wave) travels at 50-99% light speed.</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>Resistors, sometimes made from both conductors and insulators impede flow by forcing barriers into the path. Here, energy is lost and heat emitted.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>Resistors, sometimes made from both conductors and insulators impede flow by forcing barriers into the path. Energy is converted to heat.</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>Rate of flow $I$ = current \[charge/second or "amps A"] ("I" from "intensity" which is only confusing. Also charge is measured in coulombs, which is equivalent to a bunch of electrons)</span>
<span class='rem'>"pressure" $V$ = voltage \[energy/charge or "volts V"]. Always applies between two points. There is no such thing as absolute voltage. There is an amount of energy per electron, called electronvolt. Moving electrons around requires non-linear energy. so energy/charge increases as the delta energy increases.</span>
<span class='rem'>There any connection to batteries charging slowly?</span>
<span class='rem'>resistance indicating how much the material impedes flow $R$ \[ohms $\Omega$ or Joule-seconds/charge² which is not intuitive at all!]</span>
<span class='rem'>also conductance \[Siemens $S$] which is just inverse of resistance.</span>
<span class='rem'>Power $P$ neatly fit into place with $V*I$ being giving energy / second or Watts $W$.</span>
<span class='add'>In a silicon crystal, there are no free electrons.</span>
<span class='add'>It is possible to replace some silicon atoms with others that will either have free floating electrons or too few electrons to connect in the grid and will thus produce an electron hole. Both materials thus become conductors. They remain electrically neutral.</span>
<span class='add'>If placed next to each other, some free electrons flow to over to fill the electron holes. But now there is an electron imbalance that wants them to flow back. This prevents all free electrons filling the holes in the other material.</span>
<span class='add'>If more electrons are added to the side of free floating electrons and a deficit connected to the other side. The side which lack electrons will lack even more and the side that has them will have even more and quickly the pressure is large enough for electrons to jump float through the non-conductive gap.</span>
<span class='add'>In the other direction, electrons will first fill the electron holes and on the other side they will be sucked out, effectively eliminating charge carries and widening the non-conductive gap (depletion zone). Only if a large voltage is applied, do electrons flow again.</span>
<span class='add'>(Diode)</span>
<span class='add'>Transistors can be built from an n-p-n arrangement (or p-n-p) where each n-p or p-n interface has a depletion zone and so, is a diode. No electrions flow unless a large voltage is applied. (source, drain).</span>
<span class='add'>Between source and drain is a capacitor (gate), that if activated sucks electrons in (or out) of the depletion zone and that creates a small channel where charge can flow freely.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>=> switch, that can switch based on a signal (don't have to use manually).</span>
<span class='add'>These switches are off by default. I can make them on by default if I let electrons flow through a lower-resistance path if the switch is on (bypassing the output, making it 0. If the switch is off, all electrons flow to the output, making it 1).</span>
<span class='rem'>Then kirchhoffs laws</span>
<span class='rem'>and ohms law</span>
<span class='rem'>(observations)</span>
<span class='rem'>which together explain parallel and series circuits' behaviour</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>? maxwells equations -> eletromagnetism</span>
<span class='rem'>? coulombs law for forces between charged stuff</span>
<span class='add'>Transistors exibit if-then behaviour, controllable purely by their connections to each other.</span>
<span class='add'>Various gates can be built from them, which is another language to simplify logic design (OR, NAND, NOT, AND, XOR,...). And more complex machines like adders, multipliers, data storage. They are all transistors.</span>
<span class='add'>When trying to save or reuse a calculation result somewhere else, a particular problem comes up. The output of an adder for example is not immediately stable. For example, 19+21 will first calculate 30 (1+2 and 9+1) and will then carry over the one from 9+1 to produce 40, the correct answer. To deal with this, computers have clocks that preiodically send out 0s and 1s. Storage will only accept input if the clock is on a 1 cycle. The clock is timed such that any calculation can stabilize during the 0 cycle. They also help synchronized processes.</span>
<span class='add'>Each gate and each larger part has a truth table, which defines which outputs are expected under which inputs. Any truth table can be realized with transistors and their connections.</span>
<span class='add'>Many ways exist to implement switches. Field effect transistors (FETs), as presented here are nice because they have fast switching speeds and are very small, so they can be packed densly, produce little resistance for electricity and can switch fast because the capacitors needs to pull / push only a small distance to create a large channel.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>Building chips is rather difficult and expensive, so processors are most often built to be general-purpose processors that can be programmed for any possible behaviour. The processor optimization and their actual usecase better align well.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>Naively, to make an intelligent system, the challenge is to find a truth table of a system that can accurately reproduce a sequence of events and that can then build on that.</span>
<span class='add'>In this view, intelligence is prioritizing the information that is most useful to predict future states. So the most accurate possible and stable information can be generated from a truth table.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>A programmable processor is essentially a truth table, that when fed with certain instructions (parallel wires, either Low (0) or High (1)) will produce the expected output.</span>
<span class='add'>Another language is introduced to describe these instruction in a human-readable way. eg. C=A+B, where storage C will contain the content of A and the content of B added up after this instruction.</span>
<span class='add'>More abstract languages help to define for-loops and if-statements and even more abstract languages will have libraries that help me use the network interface, the monitor, the mouse, all very easily, grouping together many smaller commands in single larger command.</span>

<span>Towards spirit stream.md</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'>There seems to be way living inward, but genuinely interesting things come from the unknown. And turning outward seems like a great adventure. I am curious to share and visit minds. The spirit stream could become the tool.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>stream = raw information I choose to share</span>
<span class='rem'>spirit = meta being(s) behind the stream</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>1. the spirit stream expands the user into the digital world with minimal effort</span>
<span class='rem'>2. It meets the reader where it can expand him</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>How to build the spirit stream?</span>

<span class='hdg'>Stream components derivation</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'>I am an information structuring engine</span>
<span class='rem'>continuous stream picks up and repeats patterns, initially chaotic and far-reaching, then filtered, refined to form few knowledge blocks in areas of interest, easy to build on.</span>
<span class='rem'>refining means passing through the blocks from different angles, connecting them and testing for coherence. they may fragment into smaller blocks to become more reusable.</span>
<span class='rem'>a concise, stable path through the blocks - the ultimate test of their consistency - is a true story.</span>
<span class='add'>Senses explore, parse, filter</span>
<span class='add'>Stream of consciousness repeats patterns from</span>
<span class='add'>chaotic and far-reaching</span>
<span class='add'>to filtered and coherent knowledge</span>
<span class='add'>to actionable stories</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>Rendering the ideas into less complex and more concrete language is handy to differentiate and condense them.</span>
<span class='rem'>There is always an incentive for more forms of expression and increasingly precise vocabulary (symbols, words, video, images, 3D, animation,...). But the difficulty in expression seems to be crystallizing the implicit, drawing boundaries and most ideas can probably be compressed into a tiny vocabulary.</span>
<span class='add'>Writing, graphs, images, products</span>
<span class='add'>and the tools to build them</span>
<span class='add'>in progress</span>
<span class='add'>in memory</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>As the story becomes refined, its symbols approach realism for maximally dense and applicable representation. Eventually, the true story is indistinguishable from life.</span>
<span class='add'>Large vocabulary is deceptive</span>
<span class='add'>Hard is simplification</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>Like entering the wild, refining collected information is looking for gems.</span>
<span class='add'>Share the process in truth to</span>
<span class='add'>test, be surprised, dance, reproduce, join the cutting edge, offer, cohere, support, punish</span>
<span class='add'>into common languages per context</span>
<span class='add'>into any scopes</span>
<span class='add'>with any conditions</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>Where I am,</span>
<span class='add'>When I am.</span>
<span class='rem'>sharing structures/stories, they are further tested. A successful meme directly enteres the recipient, who tests it for consistency in their own mind.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Assuming the goal is playing a long and interesting game. Making sharing of discoveries, offers, uncertainties, plans, progress and spheres of mind context easy means offering a more synchronized, everybody-on-the-front-line discovery tour of the universe.</span>
<span class='rem'>Seems more interesting than remaining in a confined environment and negotiating with its dominant structure.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Sharing requires rendering into a common language. Physical world can be a common vocabulary, content is then direct experience. This precedes necessity for abstract symbols.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Sharing requires a scope of recipients.</span>
<span class='rem'>Precise scope selection becomes unpractical with many participants and most scopes seem to be either very private or very public.</span>
<span class='rem'>Scopes can also overlap and be one-way or two-way. Ugly They are an attempt to categorize the unknown. There should be a less ugly solution.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The spirit stream is both a room to build out and live in and feedback generator. Feedback can take various forms: Ideas, extended reach, money and more.</span>
<span class='rem'>Looking for an environment that responds back. Video games respond. I seek a group to create things. I don't know where to find it. So I create and see where it leads.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The spirit stream is also an enabler for ultra capitalism, bringing everyday microtransactions closer and making cooperation -> competition more accessible.</span>
<span class='rem'>Probably, extreme capitalism is indistinguishable from traditional group- or "mind internal" dynamics.</span>
<span class='rem'>It forwards the rules of reality to the user without middlemen - , but with some communication tools, possilby extendable to an infinitely large group / mind.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Trust (predictability, tracjectory estimation) benefits greatly from keeping a history of the spirit stream.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>if reuse is easy enough, cooperation works without shared files which require negotiation to stay tidy. Instead, everyone builds their own stuff, reusing others' work, optionally paying for it.</span>
<span class='rem'>In an information rich environment, betrayal and exploitation are easily detected and not worth it. simply need to spread information easily and offer easy ways to compensate someone.</span>
<span class='rem'>if the system becomes corrupted, it should be extremely easy to fork and rebuild it somewhere else.</span>

<span class='rem'>On the other side, the reader is responsible for rendering the content into a suitable (personal) language (content -> decoding with vocabulary -> render engine) and for navigating it (filtering, finding most appropriate sources).</span>
<span class='rem'>Most content tries to pre-render for the reader (calendars switch days automatically, have some "mind"(program) of their own. Recommendation algorithms try to emulate my attention patterns. Same for references in a book). This is cheap and ugly.</span>
<span class='rem'>- can only use commonly defined languages, most of which I don't speak and can't verify</span>
<span class='rem'>- guessing what interface the reader might prefer, automatically pissing off others and possibly limiting functionality for "simplicity"</span>
<span class='rem'>- guessing what previous knowledge and interests the reader has, boring some and overwhelming others.</span>
<span class='rem'>Imo the "true" solution to this is client side AI that filters and translates optimally for the user (different product to the spirit stream).</span>
<span class='rem'>Don't build dystopian content moderation, but build user-owned tools to scrape and translate the interent for them.</span>
<span class='rem'>Scraping the internet is more expensive than using services to "notify" me of news and link to appropriate media.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The spirit streams is supported further by:</span>
<span class='rem'>- direct exchange, with private-public scope selection</span>
<span class='rem'>- forms of payment</span>
<span class='rem'>- privacy / lack of intrusion</span>
<span class='rem'>- cheap, easy and effective client side scrape-filter-translate</span>
<span class='rem'>- simplicity and accessibility, so it can be easily altered/reproduced.</span>

<span class='rem'>Problem: Readers may expect a note to be an essay, but really they are anywhere between stream of consciousness and essay.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>A differentiation appears necessary.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Two folders ("More refined" and "Less refined") could solve the problem, but they introduce new ones too:</span>
<span class='rem'>- Are they folded open or closed and require a click to open?</span>
<span class='rem'>- They obscure the standard sorting by "modified date"</span>
<span class='rem'>Adding a prefix to the note link seems preferable. It will have ✦ to indicate percentage of content unter the heading "More refined". 20 40 60 80 100 percent for each star. However, the prefix should be generated to use the closest percentage, so the true thresholds are 10 30 50 70 90 percent to get the next star respectively.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>I think there will never be many notes on this site, because they tend to merge or be replaced by better ones. Density will increase instead.</span>
<span class='rem'>For "topic" differentiation, note titles and their internal headings should suffice.</span>
<span class='rem'>If I need folders, I am doing it wrong.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Example:</span>
<span class='rem'>2024 09 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microprocessors</span>

<span class='rem'>- [Schelling points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)), allowing large groups of people to quickly coordinate around a single path forward. Complex Schelling points could potentially even be implemented in code (eg. [recovery from 51% attacks](https://ethresear.ch/t/timeliness-detectors-and-51-attack-recovery-in-blockchains/6925) can benefit from this).</span>
<span class='rem'>- Speaking a common language (or alternatively, splitting control between multiple constituencies who speak different languages)</span>
<span class='rem'>- Using per-person voting instead of per-(coin/share) voting to greatly increase the number of people who would need to collude to affect a decision</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>>This all leads us to an interesting view of what it is that people building social systems _do_. One of the goals of building an effective social system is, in large part, determining _the structure of coordination_: which groups of people and in what configurations can come together to further their group goals, and which groups cannot?</span>

<span class='rem'>(much of this thought seems unnecessary to me. The structure of reality will reveal itself when the tools allow it. If collusion is the optimal strategy, then so be it. Not sure what the purpose of a social system is. If anything were allowed and people build structure on it like filters, undoing privacy, subspaces, would it not be desirable? The best system is no system? If the structure can contain reality it will, and reality, as death, will be the appropriate judge?</span>

<span class='add'>Paying open, precise attention to experience, I gain distance and loose track of the self, which is more of a reference point than a discrete perception. So *I* die and the world as sensed and my motivations - spirits - and my feelings and thoughts trying to make sense become less disitinguishable. Experience flows through me, perceptions lead to actions all by themselves. The moment - all that exists - is enough, no matter the pain, joy, fear or hope.</span>
<span class='add'>From this place, I bring back deep appreciation for experience and the uncontrolled flow of self into the world. It's that against destruction and apathy.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Negotiating between my spirits to form an approximately coherent dance is a great source of meaning and adventure.</span>
<span class='add'>All spirits are heard and integrated. There is no evil spirit to shut out, but there can be excess.</span>
<span class='add'>Integrity is happiest, strongest, most durable and adventurous. Its outcome is truly unknown, scary, exciting, much more interesting than lying propaganda to maintain arbitrary ideology.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>On this open-outcome journey I value other spirits and tools that are true to their nature and who I can merge with, even temporarily.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Mine and all other spirits (humans, animals, plants, memes, programs) compete for existence. Long term, free market always wins because it has the most accurate and flexible connection to reality.</span>
<span class='add'>The spirits and the market benefit from coherence - in world model and through cooperation.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>My spirits deeply want to increase coherence, shape and force the environment to reflect themselves. An environment that adapts to them and responds with its own integrated spirit. If the link becomes strong enough, the environment is colonized and enters the perceived self seamlessly.</span>
<span class='add'>This is how they colonized the body. They want to colonize the universe.</span>

<span class='rem'>>The `LazyBuffer` graph specifies the compute in terms of low level tinygrad ops. Not all LazyBuffers will actually become realized. There's two types of LazyBuffers, base and view. base contains compute into a contiguous buffer, and view is a view (specified by a ShapeTracker). Inputs to a base can be either base or view, inputs to a view can only be a single base.</span>

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Tensor.rand uses numpy for rng. created upon realize. maybe MetaOps.CUSTOM makes realize call the function in arg, which here produces the numpy array for the buffer.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>**getting weights:**</span>
<span class='rem'>reads huggingface gtp2 weights as raw bytes</span>
<span class='rem'>makes a huge Tensor on device DISK:path with one dim and shape of file size in bytes</span>
<span class='rem'>unpickles the bytes object, helping with custom `find_class` to translate torch dtypes to tinygrad dtypes.</span>
<span class='rem'>and rebuilding torch tensors with `_rebuild_tensor_v2`</span>
<span class='rem'>takes slices from the huge tensor to rebuild gpt2. slice (Tensor.shrink) changes the view to have an offset and adjusted shape.</span>
<span class='rem'>Does a useless flip in case the stride in the slice is -1. Does not detect that its useless, just flips anyway.</span>
<span class='rem'>bitcasts from `uchar` (=`uint8`)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to `float32`. -> size /= 4</span>
<span class='rem'>gets the new lazybuffer a new buffer with the new shape and the old buffer as its base and offset.</span>
<span class='rem'>then reshapes the flat tensor.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>permute is a reshape but also changes order of strides.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>it makesa model with all the tensors of gtp2, then realizes the disk tensors one by one and replaces the tensor in the gpt2 model with the realized disk tensor</span>

<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>There is a state of mind where I recognize that I don't own myself. That "I" don't exist. Rather, I am experience and the structure of the world (brain, body, universe) merely acts through me. Meditation is looking closely and waking up from the dream to see that the world is constructed all by itself in my mind, that I am taken along on a ride through experience.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>There, when I meet other people and am truly present, their expressions enter my perception similar to my own. But now the underlying structure is not only my own and the apparently physical world, but there are spirits acting in it: another space to be explored. To be poked at, challenged, supported. If the spirits come to agree and when exchange is saturated, effectively two minds are now entering the world, realizing themselves.</span>
<span class='rem'>Thus, with genuine curiosity, minds can be explored and possibly merged with.</span>
<span class='rem'>When the spirits reveal themselves openly and the rest of the world is allowed to reveal itself as it is, more can be explored, understood, made coherent, built on.</span>
<span class='rem'>I don't understand where I come from. Expressing it, following it is truly adventurous.</span>
<span class='rem'>There is a way of recognizing something beautiful even in darkness. Where the perceptions are reflective of an underlying structure. Where a spirit roams free.</span>
<span class='rem'>With reason, structures are built. An approximately coherent image. It includes the world, my own spirits and plans on how to realize the spirits.</span>
<span class='rem'>Great danger comes from excluding spirits.</span>
<span class='rem'>What Peterson might see in the bible is a pre-negotiated set of rules which offers a path of broad coherence. In a sense, it is another spirit that can be negotiated with, that can extend my own spirit. It also provides a language to think of the spirits. This language throws me off and I often don't recognize myself in it.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Coherent underestanding of the spirits and the world serves fulfillment of the spirits. Towards coherence, the relationships and distinctions in spirit and world model become increasingly precise. Much like resolution increasing, except it is not pixel resolution where few pixels already have precise colors that only gain detail, but it is conceptual resolution, where connections become increasingly accurate and the image can change significantly over time.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>These abstract structures are never complete because they are trying to formalize something currently deeply unknown: the structure of the mind after evolution (mind became a reflection of the universe itself) and randomness.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>As abstract structures are translated into increasingly concrete languages, they enter stories. Story is a journey through the structure as it is applied to the world. Stories can come from many angles and also serve verification of the structure.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
</div>
<span class='rem'>Goal stack</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>0. Merge with other brains, explore the unknown, accelerate each other and build.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>1. Independent learning systems will uncover new space in possibility, find human brains, interact, possibly exploit them for their needs. If the mind is truly open and on fast access and will not reject the intruder, but reveal its structure, the system may be curious. I have no intuition here.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>2. BCIs will allow extension of the spirit into new forms, seamlessly extend thinking, solve learning and challenge the spirit like never before to direct its powers. They will allow the true transformation - altering minds is the last frontier. Capturing experience will go deeper than before. BCIs and independent learning systems combined are the Scariest, the most Curious, the hardest to implement. It will allow merging minds from anywhere given low enough latency. </span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I truly wonder what it would be like. Much of thought is like staring at a hole and iterating through paths to bridge it. Maybe there are many simultaneous holes and I am searching for an arrangement to shoot straight through them. It requires maintaining the context with all holes and working on multiple at the same time. Expanding the context of my mind might be extremely difficult. Instead, the context may contain items of increasingly broad scope, understood more deeply. Maybe contexts can be efficiently stored, restored.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>3. Tiny corp accelerator distributes compute into more hands. Builds a bridge between ML framework and low level.</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its approach is admirable. it reveals the nature and power of computation for everyone to see and use.</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It concerns itself with the technicalities for making increasingly fast, efficient and well-integrated processors. It includes some user experience in its API, the tiny box and internal representation.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>4. Personal robots will manifest the growing intelligence, become a frontend. Building them concerns itself with materials, mechanics, packaging and machine-human interaction. They require strong interfaces to be cool. If it's "the robot and me" and not "me and an extra me-instance", it sucks. The personal robots will free individuals to be increasingly independent.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>5. Spider hats (data collector my head, recording experience) will provide data for minds to merge and flood the internet with what would be garbage for most people and contexts.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>6. virtual clones could make use of sparse or spider hat data to become an interface to the world, research, negotiate, use tools in my stead. Being built right now. They may make my software more userfriendly and trustworthy than it is today (become an OS that does not treat me like an idiot and teaches me how it works).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>7. Simple, versatile communication media. Probably change nothing. They may accelerate the interface for noobs but pro tools for self expression and compressing ideas are the real deal. Not dumping it in a particularly optimized format. I don't even use many "pro tools" though.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>

<span class='add'>There is a state of mind where I recognize that I don't own myself. That "I" don't exist. Rather, I am experience and the structure of the world (brain, body, universe) merely acts through me. Meditation is looking closely and waking up from the dream to see that the world is constructed all by itself in my mind, that I am taken along on a ride through experience.</span>
<span class='add'>There, when I meet other people and am truly present, their expressions enter my perception similar to my own. But now the underlying structure is not only my own and the apparently physical world, but there are other spirits acting in it. To be poked at, explored, supported. If the spirits come to agree and when exchange is saturated, effectively two minds are now entering the world, realizing themselves as one.</span>
<span class='add'>With genuine curiosity, minds can be explored and possibly merged with.</span>
<span class='add'>Great danger comes from excluding spirits.</span>
<span class='add'>What Peterson might see in the bible is a pre-negotiated set of rules which offers a path of broad coherence. In a sense, it is another spirit that can be negotiated with, that can extend my own spirit. It also provides a language to think of the spirits. This language throws me off and I often don't recognize myself in it.</span>

It requires maintaining the context with all holes and working on multiple at the same time. Expanding the context of my mind might be extremely difficult. Instead, the context may contain items of increasingly broad scope, understood more deeply. Maybe contexts can be efficiently stored, restored.</span>

<span class='rem'>>One important property of especially the milder cases of collusion is that one cannot determine whether or not an action is part of an undesired collusion just by looking at the action itself.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>>[...]votes where vote selling is permitted quickly [collapse into plutocracy](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2019/04/03/collusion.html).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>>[...] in [...] _cooperative game theory_, [we can prove that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondareva%E2%80%93Shapley_theorem) there are large classes of games that do not have any stable outcome (called a "[core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_(game_theory))"). In such games, whatever the current state of affairs is, there is always some coalition that can profitably deviate from it.</span>
<span class='rem'>>One important part of that set of inherently unstable games is _majority games_. A majority game [is formally described](https://web.archive.org/web/20180329012328/https://www.math.mcgill.ca/vetta/CS764.dir/Core.pdf) as a game of agents where any subset of more than half of them can capture a fixed reward and split it among themselves</span>

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>>**Counter-coordination**. The fact that a system is decentralized makes it easy for participants not participating in the collusion to make a fork that strips out the colluding attackers and continue the system from there.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>mechanisms against collusion:</span>
<span class='rem'>- privacy protection</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- secret ballot</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- protection of whistleblowers</span>
<span class='rem'>- reward to whistleblowers</span>
<span class='rem'>- Counter-coordination</span>
<span class='rem'>- skin in the game for the colluders</span>
<span class='rem'>- Decentralization in physical space</span>
<span class='rem'>- Decentralization between role-based constituencies</span>
<span class='rem'>- [Schelling points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)), allowing large groups of people to quickly coordinate around a single path forward. Complex Schelling points could potentially even be implemented in code (eg. [recovery from 51% attacks](https://ethresear.ch/t/timeliness-detectors-and-51-attack-recovery-in-blockchains/6925) can benefit from this).</span>
<span class='rem'>- Speaking a common language (or alternatively, splitting control between multiple constituencies who speak different languages)</span>
<span class='rem'>- Using per-person voting instead of per-(coin/share) voting to greatly increase the number of people who would need to collude to affect a decision</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>>This all leads us to an interesting view of what it is that people building social systems _do_. One of the goals of building an effective social system is, in large part, determining _the structure of coordination_: which groups of people and in what configurations can come together to further their group goals, and which groups cannot?</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>(much of this thought seems unnecessary to me. The structure of reality will reveal itself when the tools allow it. If collusion is the optimal strategy, then so be it. Not sure what the purpose of a social system is. If anything were allowed and people build structure on it like filters, undoing privacy, subspaces, would it not be desirable? The best system is no system? If the structure can contain reality it will, and reality, as death, will be the appropriate judge?</span>

<span class='add'>>One important property of especially the milder cases of collusion is that one cannot determine whether or not an action is part of an undesired collusion just by looking at the action itself.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>>[...]votes where vote selling is permitted quickly [collapse into plutocracy](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2019/04/03/collusion.html).</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>>[...] in [...] _cooperative game theory_, [we can prove that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondareva%E2%80%93Shapley_theorem) there are large classes of games that do not have any stable outcome (called a "[core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_(game_theory))"). In such games, whatever the current state of affairs is, there is always some coalition that can profitably deviate from it.</span>
<span class='add'>>One important part of that set of inherently unstable games is _majority games_. A majority game [is formally described](https://web.archive.org/web/20180329012328/https://www.math.mcgill.ca/vetta/CS764.dir/Core.pdf) as a game of agents where any subset of more than half of them can capture a fixed reward and split it among themselves</span>

<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>>**Counter-coordination**. The fact that a system is decentralized makes it easy for participants not participating in the collusion to make a fork that strips out the colluding attackers and continue the system from there.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>mechanisms against collusion:</span>
<span class='add'>- privacy protection</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- secret ballot</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- protection of whistleblowers</span>
<span class='add'>- reward to whistleblowers</span>
<span class='add'>- Counter-coordination</span>
<span class='add'>- skin in the game for colluders</span>
<span class='add'>- Decentralization</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- in physical space</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- between role-based constituents</span>
<span class='add'>- [Schelling points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)), allowing large groups of people to quickly coordinate around a single path forward. Complex Schelling points could potentially even be implemented in code (eg. [recovery from 51% attacks](https://ethresear.ch/t/timeliness-detectors-and-51-attack-recovery-in-blockchains/6925) can benefit from this).</span>
<span class='add'>- Speaking a common language (or alternatively, splitting control between multiple constituencies who speak different languages)</span>
<span class='add'>- Using per-person voting instead of per-(coin/share) voting to greatly increase the number of people who would need to collude to affect a decision</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>>This all leads us to an interesting view of what it is that people building social systems _do_. One of the goals of building an effective social system is, in large part, determining _the structure of coordination_: which groups of people and in what configurations can come together to further their group goals, and which groups cannot?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>(much of this thought seems unnecessary to me. The structure of reality will reveal itself when the tools allow it. If collusion is the optimal strategy, then so be it. Not sure what the purpose of a social system is. If anything were allowed and people build structure on it like filters, undoing privacy, subspaces, would it not be desirable? The best system is no system? If the structure can contain reality it will, and reality, as death, will be the appropriate judge?</span>

<span class='add'>Negotiating between the spirits to form an approx. coherent meta-spirit (dance) and dancing in it is a great source of meaning and adventure. The goal is integrity (can be accessed anywhere) and the outcome is truly unknown (scary, exciting, much more interesting than lying propaganda to maintain arbitrary ideology).</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Integrity as a goal limits the self/ego and is can exist in any situation, including in evil or fear. Both reflect life and can be appreciated as such.</span>
<span class='add'>For this open-outcome journey I appreciate people and tools that are true to their nature (spirits if humans, use/meaning if tools).</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>The spirits and metaspirits (memes) exist on a free market. The free market always wins because it has the most accurate and flexible connection to reality.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>The spirits and the market benefit from coherence: listening to the spirits and experience and improving world model accuracy.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>My spirits want to increase coherence, shape my environment to reflect their relationship to the physical world. An environment that adapts to them and responds with its own spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the environment and other spirits are integrated to coherence, they are colonized.

<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>There is a state of mind where I recognize that I don't own myself. That "I" don't exist. Rather, I am experience and the structure of the world (brain, body, universe) merely acts through me. Meditation is looking closely and waking up from the dream to see that the world is constructed all by itself in my mind, that I am taken along on a ride through experience.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>There, when I meet other people and am truly present, their expressions enter my perception similar to my own. But now the underlying structure is not only my own and the apparently physical world, but there are spirits acting in it: another space to be explored. To be poked at, challenged, supported. If the spirits come to agree and when exchange is saturated, effectively two minds are now entering the world, realizing themselves.</span>
<span class='add'>Thus, with genuine curiosity, minds can be explored and possibly merged with.</span>
<span class='add'>When the spirits reveal themselves openly and the rest of the world is allowed to reveal itself as it is, more can be explored, understood, made coherent, built on.</span>
<span class='add'>I don't understand where I come from. Expressing it, following it is truly adventurous.</span>
<span class='add'>There is a way of recognizing something beautiful even in darkness. Where the perceptions are reflective of an underlying structure. Where a spirit roams free.</span>
<span class='add'>With reason, structures are built. An approximately coherent image. It includes the world, my own spirits and plans on how to realize the spirits.</span>
<span class='add'>Great danger comes from excluding spirits.</span>
<span class='add'>What Peterson might see in the bible is a pre-negotiated set of rules which offers a path of broad coherence. In a sense, it is another spirit that can be negotiated with, that can extend my own spirit. It also provides a language to think of the spirits. This language throws me off and I often don't recognize myself in it.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Coherent underestanding of the spirits and the world serves fulfillment of the spirits. Towards coherence, the relationships and distinctions in spirit and world model become increasingly precise. Much like resolution increasing, except it is not pixel resolution where few pixels already have precise colors that only gain detail, but it is conceptual resolution, where connections become increasingly accurate and the image can change significantly over time.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>These abstract structures are never complete because they are trying to formalize something currently deeply unknown: the structure of the mind after evolution (mind became a reflection of the universe itself) and randomness.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>As abstract structures are translated into increasingly concrete languages, they enter stories. Story is a journey through the structure as it is applied to the world. Stories can come from many angles and also serve verification of the structure.</span>

<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>(there are many ways to implement logic gates but electronics seems to be the dominant one, so on to electronics!)</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>In some substrates, there are electrons loosely bound to their atom cores. They are presumably far away from it.</span>
<span class='add'>If there is an electron surplus on one side and an electron deficit on the other, they will leave their atom and flow in the direction of the deficit. Electrons are said to be negatively charged. They repell each other (away from the surplus) and are attracted to positive charge (towards the deficit, where positively charged protons outweigh the electrons).</span>
<span class='add'>An imbalance in electrons can be generated in various ways. One is rubbing certain materials and for some reason the heat will cause some electrons from one material to jump to the other.</span>
<span class='add'>The actual electron flow is slow, but the "wave" (electromagnetic wave) travels at 50-99% light speed.</span>
<span class='add'>More loose electrons = better conductor.</span>
<span class='add'>Resistors, sometimes made from both conductors and insulators impede flow by forcing barriers into the path. Here, energy is lost and heat emitted.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Rate of flow $I$ = current \[charge/second or "amps A"] ("I" from "intensity" which is only confusing. Also charge is measured in coulombs, which is equivalent to a bunch of electrons)</span>
<span class='add'>"pressure" $V$ = voltage \[energy/charge or "volts V"]. Always applies between two points. There is no such thing as absolute voltage. There is an amount of energy per electron, called electronvolt. Moving electrons around requires non-linear energy. so energy/charge increases as the delta energy increases.</span>
<span class='add'>There any connection to batteries charging slowly?</span>
<span class='add'>resistance indicating how much the material impedes flow $R$ \[ohms $\Omega$ or Joule-seconds/charge² which is not intuitive at all!]</span>
<span class='add'>also conductance \[Siemens $S$] which is just inverse of resistance.</span>
<span class='add'>Power $P$ neatly fit into place with $V*I$ being giving energy / second or Watts $W$.</span>

<span class='add'>Rendering the ideas into less complex and more concrete language is handy to differentiate and condense them.</span>
<span class='add'>There is always an incentive for more forms of expression and increasingly precise vocabulary (symbols, words, video, images, 3D, animation,...). But the difficulty in expression seems to be crystallizing the implicit, drawing boundaries and most ideas can probably be compressed into a tiny vocabulary.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>Sharing requires rendering into a common language. Physical world can be a common vocabulary, content is then direct experience. This precedes necessity for abstract symbols.</span>
<span class='rem'>Looking for an environment that responds back. Video games respond. It may be my fault that my environment does not very much respond. I seek a group to create things. I don't know where to find it.</span>
<span class='rem'>The current path says "Working on something to build groups, and large ones, I may find a group and then the tools may enable the group to grow".</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>In exchange for participation, one gets response. Who feels unable or unwilling to respond meaningfully, can offer reach, credit or money.</span>
<span class='add'>Sharing requires a scope of recipients.</span>
<span class='add'>Precise scope selection becomes unpractical with many participants and most scopes seem to be either very private or very public.</span>
<span class='add'>Scopes can also overlap and be one-way or two-way. Ugly They are an attempt to categorize the unknown. There should be a less ugly solution.</span>

<span class='add'>The spirit stream is both a room to build out and live in and feedback generator. Feedback can take various forms: Ideas, extended reach, money and more.</span>

<span class='rem'>In summary, the spirit stream has two parts: </span>
<br>
<span class='add'>In summary, the spirit stream has:</span>
<span class='rem'>- the stream (hammer blows)</span>
<span class='rem'>- the structure->blocks->stories the author is building through the stream (sculpture). Maybe the structure is a physical tool or a space of "pinned" ideas to repeat going through and refining them.</span>
<span class='add'>- content with "resolutions" between "raw stream" (hammer blows) to specific ideas -> blocks -> stories (sculptures). Content can take any form including physical products.</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- rendered in personal vocablary and structure</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- transmission-optimized version for sharing</span>
<span class='add'>- content history, optionally maintained and shared</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>its development is furthered by:</span>
<span class='rem'>- abitrary direct exchange, private or public</span>
<span class='add'>On the other side, the reader is responsible for rendering the content into a suitable (personal) language (content -> decoding with vocabulary -> render engine) and for navigating it (filtering, finding most appropriate sources).</span>
<span class='add'>Most content tries to pre-render for the reader (calendars switch days automatically, have some "mind"(program) of their own. Recommendation algorithms try to emulate my attention patterns. Same for references in a book). This is cheap and ugly.</span>
<span class='add'>- can only use commonly defined languages, most of which I don't speak and can't verify</span>
<span class='add'>- guessing what interface the reader might prefer, automatically pissing off others and possibly limiting functionality for "simplicity"</span>
<span class='add'>- guessing what previous knowledge and interests the reader has, boring some and overwhelming others.</span>
<span class='add'>Imo the "true" solution to this is client side AI that filters and translates optimally for the user (different product to the spirit stream).</span>
<span class='add'>Don't build dystopian content moderation, but build user-owned tools to scrape and translate the interent for them.</span>
<span class='add'>Scraping the internet is more expensive than using services to "notify" me of news and link to appropriate media.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>The spirit streams is supported further by:</span>
<span class='add'>- direct exchange, with private-public scope selection</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>- cheap, easy and effective client side scrape-filter-translate</span>
<span class='add'>- simplicity and accessibility, so it can be easily altered/reproduced.</span>

<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>A differentiation appears necessary.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Two folders ("More refined" and "Less refined") could solve the problem, but they introduce new ones too:</span>
<span class='add'>- Are they folded open or closed and require a click to open?</span>
<span class='add'>- They obscure the standard sorting by "modified date"</span>
<span class='add'>Adding a prefix to the note link seems preferable. It will have ✦ to indicate percentage of content unter the heading "More refined". 20 40 60 80 100 percent for each star. However, the prefix should be generated to use the closest percentage, so the true thresholds are 10 30 50 70 90 percent to get the next star respectively.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>I think there will never be many notes on this site, because they tend to merge or be replaced by better ones. Density will increase instead.</span>

<span class='add'>1. Introduction</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Why massively parallel processors?</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Because depending on the program</span>
<span class='add'>- massively parallel, throughput-orientied processors, commonly referred to as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs, graphics was their first leading application),</span>
<span class='add'>- latency-oriented, less parallel, general-purpose processors, traditionally referred to as Central Processing Units (CPUs, every computer has one),</span>
<span class='add'>- or a combination of both</span>
<span class='add'>could be fastest or most efficient.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![](attachments/CPUvsGPU.png)</span>
<span class='add'>*Cache = fast on-chip memory</span>
<span class='add'>DRAM = "slow" off-chip Dynamic Random Access Memory</span>
<span class='add'>Many CPUs also have a GPU on the same chip, which is less powerful than contemporanous, discrete ones.*</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>These approaches are distinct, because optimizing for low latency means</span>

<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- control units for better utilization</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with diminishing returns</span>
<span class='add'>- increasing clock rate -> higher voltage -> exponentially higher power consumption</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Throughput-oriented processors use the chip area for more processing units at lower clockrates and implement parallel memory access. This leads to much higher throughput for similar cost and power consumption.</span>

<span class='add'>Many tasks in simulation, graphics processing and machine learning inherently offer potential for parallelization and so, can benefit from throughput-oriented processors.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Graphics processing because each pixel can often be treated independently.</span>
<span class='add'>machine learning because it involves many matrix multiplications that can be done in parallel.</span>

<span class='add'>It's a guide on using GPUs effectively, which requires careful, application specific management of their many processing units and small caches and cooperation with the CPU.</span>
<span class='add'>Various, reportedly similar, programming models exist to accomplish this and here, Nvidias Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) will be used. It works on Nvidia GPUs only, is the best performing and most widely used.</span>

</div>
<span class='add'>Less refined</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>GPUs bottom up</span>
<span class='add'>I know why they are built.</span>
<span class='add'>actually I don't because I don't know how CPUs use their Caches and Control Units and higher clock rates to improve performance.</span>
<span class='add'>leaving aside exact implementation, how are GPUs organized so I can benefit from them optimally?</span>
<span class='add'>how precisely do I program them?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>organized around streaming multiprocessors and memory hierarchy</span>
<span class='add'>so they can cooperate: share memory for speed and synchronize (for?)</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>- grid -> (blockCluster ->) block -> thread.</span>
<span class='add'>- warps are more hardware related and translate threads to the cores?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>2. Heterogenous data parallel computing</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>2.1 Data parallelism</span>
<span class='add'>- data parellelism where I can treat individual data points independetly to a varying degree. example: converting image to grayscale. data parellelism is main source of parallelism because the intereting applications use large amounts of data (simulation, image recognition (? matrix multiplication))</span>
<span class='add'>- task parallelism (to be explained more later) means splitting up a task into multiple independent ones. data parallelism is a simpler special case of task parallelism</span>
<span class='add'>- code is being reorganized to be executed around the new data structure</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>2.2 CUDA C program structure</span>
<span class='add'>- framework vs programming model</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- framwork provides specific functino, programming model more like a way to think about program and data structure (warps, block, threads)</span>
<span class='add'>- kernel (seed) vs function. its a function that is "launched" onto the GPU and executed for each thread</span>
<span class='add'>- cuda c extends normal c (standard / ANSI C) with keywords, some new syntax and functions to run stuff on the GPU. all normal c code runs on CPU</span>
<span class='add'>- host and device code somehow cooperate. the host launches (kernel) a grid of threads</span>
<span class='add'>- cuda threads are sequential programs with a program counter and its variables. (each thread runs the same program but effectively has an id as defined by predefined variables that differ for each thread)</span>
<span class='add'>- Generating and scheduling threads on GPU is very fast. Not on CPU. kernels tend to be simple and can just be copied into the threads. context switching is also extremely fast on GPU for latency hiding.</span>
<span class='add'>- On CPU what if I open more threads than are available on the CPU? they are switched into the physical threads</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>2.3 vector addition kernel CPU</span>
<span class='add'>- conventional c host code</span>
<span class='add'>- declaring pointers is with `float *P;`, accessing address of a variable with `int *addr = &amp;V` and getting the item at the pointer with `float V = *P`</span>
<span class='add'>- subsequent statements in the main function can use the output `C`</span>
<span class='add'>- getting ~20 MFLOPS on CPU</span>
<span class='add'>- the following code for on-device computation will practically outsource this part, but its inefficient because it will be moving a lot of dta around which is slow.</span>
<span class='add'>- it will allocate memory on device and move the arrays there, then run the kernel, then free device vectors</span>

<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>2.4 Device global memory and data transfer</span>
<span class='add'>- cudaMalloc and cudaFree</span>
<span class='add'>- cudaMalloc assigns to the argument pointer (`void **`) and returns possible errors. so there is need for the cudaCheck function.</span>
<span class='add'>- A_h and A_d for host and device</span>
<span class='add'>- the vecAdd function that allocates, copies and copies back and frees is called *stub* for calling a kernel.</span>
<span class='add'>- error checking macro</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>2.5 Kernel functions and threading</span>
<span class='add'>- the kernel functions will be written in SPMD style (single program multiple data).</span>
<span class='add'>- grid -> block -> thread</span>
<span class='add'>- 1 block = 1024 threads max</span>
<span class='add'>- threadIdx and blockidx for thread id</span>
<span class='add'>- what is ANSI C? CUDA C is an extension of ANSI C</span>
<span class='add'>- globa, host and device keywords for kernel functions.</span>
<span class='add'>- global kernel function = new grid. </span>
<span class='add'>- grid of threads = loop (loop parallelism)</span>
<span class='add'>- boundary checking</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>2.6 Calling kernel functions</span>
<span class='add'>- execution configuration parameters</span>
<span class='add'>- cannot make assumptions about execution order</span>
<span class='add'>- some gpus will work through it in smaller pieces than others</span>
<span class='add'>- language needs a compiler. NVCC produces host code (gcc?) and device code (PTX -> binary)</span>
<span class='add'>- what is the purpose of just in time compilation?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>2.7 Compilation</span>
<span class='add'>- needs a different compiler</span>
<span class='add'>- to virtual binary files (PTX)</span>
<span class='add'>- runtime component of nvcc translates to "real object files" to be executed on GPU. but in the illustration its called "device just-in-time compiler"</span>

<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Why massively parallel processors?</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Because depending on the program</span>
<span class='rem'>- massively parallel, throughput-orientied processors, commonly referred to as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs, graphics was their first leading application),</span>
<span class='rem'>- latency-oriented, less parallel, general-purpose processors, traditionally referred to as Central Processing Units (CPUs, every computer has one),</span>
<span class='rem'>- or a combination of both</span>
<span class='rem'>could be fastest or most efficient.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/CPUvsGPU.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>*ALU = Arithemtic Logic Unit, where the actual computation happens</span>
<span class='rem'>DRAM = Dynamic Random Access Memory (off-chip)</span>
<span class='rem'>Many CPUs also have a GPU on the same chip, which is less powerful than contemporanous, discete ones.*</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>These approaches are distinct, because optimizing for low latency means</span>
<span class='rem'>- sacrificing expensive chip area for</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- large caches for faster data access</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- control units for better utilization</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with diminishing returns</span>
<span class='rem'>- increasing clock rate -> higher voltage -> exponentially higher power consumption</span>

<span class='add'>Feels like merging brains, BCIs and immersive cyberspace are the same thing, from an elusive, pathetic fantasy. The not-alone, the chaotic new, the orderly consistency, continiuity between self and environment.</span>
<span class='add'>It pulls me in, irrationally, makes me vulnerable. Unlike independent systems, tiny corp, robots, spider hats. All those are comparatively clear and about revealing the properties of the outer world, not playing with the self. Feels like I am looking for comfort in the uploaded mind, the infinite self. Safety from the limitations of my body, which appears increasingly inadequate. Like becoming the world immortalizes me.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>I should find the answer in meditation, not technical knowledge. Because if I could admit it, I would see that BCIs, cyberspace and being social are not new, they only turn up some existing, obvious aspects in experience.</span>

<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>0. Merge with other brains, explore the unknown, accelerate each other and build.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>1. Independent learning systems will uncover new space in possibility, find human brains, interact, possibly exploit them for their needs. If the mind is truly open and on fast access and will not reject the intruder, but reveal its structure, the system may be curious. I have no intuition here.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>2. BCIs will allow extension of the spirit into new forms, seamlessly extend thinking, solve learning and challenge the spirit like never before to direct its powers. They will allow the true transformation - altering minds is the last frontier. Capturing experience will go deeper than before. BCIs and independent learning systems combined are the Scariest, the most Curious, the hardest to implement. It will allow merging minds from anywhere given low enough latency. </span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I truly wonder what it would be like. Much of thought is like staring at a hole and iterating through paths to bridge it. Maybe there are many simultaneous holes and I am searching for an arrangement to shoot straight through them. It requires maintaining the context with all holes and working on multiple at the same time. Expanding the context of my mind might be extremely difficult. Instead, the context may contain items of increasingly broad scope, understood more deeply. Maybe contexts can be efficiently stored, restored.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>3. Tiny corp accelerator distributes compute into more hands. Builds a bridge between ML framework and low level.</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its approach is admirable. it reveals the nature and power of computation for everyone to see and use.</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It concerns itself with the technicalities for making increasingly fast, efficient and well-integrated processors. It includes some user experience in its API, the tiny box and internal representation.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>4. Personal robots will manifest the growing intelligence, become a frontend. Building them concerns itself with materials, mechanics, packaging and machine-human interaction. They require strong interfaces to be cool. If it's "the robot and me" and not "me and an extra me-instance", it sucks. The personal robots will free individuals to be increasingly independent.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>5. Spider hats (data collector my head, recording experience) will provide data for minds to merge and flood the internet with what would be garbage for most people and contexts.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>6. virtual clones could make use of sparse or spider hat data to become an interface to the world, research, negotiate, use tools in my stead. Being built right now. They may make my software more userfriendly and trustworthy than it is today (become an OS that does not treat me like an idiot and teaches me how it works).</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>7. Simple, versatile communication media. Probably change nothing. They may accelerate the interface for noobs but pro tools for self expression and compressing ideas are the real deal. Not dumping it in a particularly optimized format. I don't even use many "pro tools" though.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>8. Publishing frameworks for the individual could encourage higher quality idea space. Anything from markdown static site generator to generic website builder.</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code as UI is nice. All is in one place, builds on text manipulation tools and no dumb menus.</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end it will be an AI I talk to and it generates or modifies nice code and the true tool beneath will be a fast, nice API for the AI to learn and use.</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tool should be general enough to allow any website, ony any host and have one-button publish.</span>
<span class='add'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extended by a "reader" API to scrape sites, assemble them into a UI. Another API for the pirvate virtual clone. Any APIs should be transparent, offer good logs to understand what is happening.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>9. Publishing platform to replace hostile attention- and data-harvesters. This would be like fighting symptoms. Instead, it should be so easy for people to publish on their own that other platforms make no sense.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>10. Functional and expressive clothing. Though it mostly modifies appearance. Rage quit from the pathetic SUV-style overlord brand identity bullshit that I find on the market.</span>
<span class='add'></span>

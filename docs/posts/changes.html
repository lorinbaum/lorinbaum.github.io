<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;files are folders linking to more files. have backlinks too. files are tags to the linked files. search through files shared by the target (links, or backlinks). give api to get size of files in a particular selection</span>
<span class='rem'>- history can only exist per file and is an interface on top of the filesystem. links in files link to the latest version. if automatically generated / updated links change, note this in the commit api and optionally add those files to history?</span>
<span class='rem'>- Interface: programmatically produce list of backlinks! and forward links by search. some code generates one-time, as a shortcut. some generates every time the file is displayed. like link lists.</span>
<span class='rem'>- text interface like cli: search bar, commands, answer questions</span>
<span class='rem'>- database stores links for faster access</span>
<span class='add'>default html links. a linked file counts as a tag. API for finding backlinks and for search by tags like below:</span>

<span class='add'>**history**</span>
<span class='add'>create snapshots: duplicate file, append datetime and link to it from `history` file.</span>

<span class='rem'>Talking about something is rather boring. The necessities of everyday life.</span>
<span class='rem'>Talking with someone intensely feels like consciously using the interface to explore the landscape of the other mind. Much like testing an input output function for its shape. There is something behind the words, the face, the body. This is an offer to merge into coherence.</span>
<span class='rem'>If there was a faster interface, its highest value would not be space for more stories to tell but space to negotiate and reach coherence. = Makes it easier to *understand* someone and reach mutually beneficial agreement.</span>

<span class='rem'>There is a state of mind where I recognize that I don't own myself. That "I" don't exist. Rather, I am experience and the structure of the world (brain, body, universe) merely acts through me. Meditation is looking closely and waking up from the dream to see that the world is constructed all by itself in my mind, that I am taken along on a ride through experience.</span>
<span class='rem'>There, when I meet other people and am truly present, their expressions enter my perception similar to my own. But now the underlying structure is not only my own and the apparently physical world, but there are other spirits acting in it. To be poked at, explored, supported. If the spirits come to agree and when exchange is saturated, effectively two minds are now entering the world, realizing themselves as one.</span>
<span class='rem'>With genuine curiosity, minds can be explored and possibly merged with.</span>
<span class='rem'>Great danger comes from excluding spirits.</span>
<span class='rem'>What Peterson might see in the bible is a pre-negotiated set of rules which offers a path of broad coherence. In a sense, it is another spirit that can be negotiated with, that can extend my own spirit. It also provides a language to think of the spirits. This language throws me off and I often don't recognize myself in it.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>--- </span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'> Much of thought is like staring at a hole and iterating through paths to bridge it. Maybe there are many simultaneous holes and I am searching for an arrangement to shoot straight through them. It requires maintaining the context with all holes and working on multiple at the same time. Expanding the context of my mind might be extremely difficult. Instead, the context may contain items of increasingly broad scope, understood more deeply. Maybe contexts can be efficiently stored, restored.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>

<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>there are bridges to be built. between the ideas, nature, work, the spirits. Curiosity leads to testing new ways to link them.</span>
<span class='rem'>building a product means actualizing the spirits, making the product beautiful requires facing and approaching beauty myself. Requires negotiating between the spirits and curageously producing something complete. at least the most complete I can manage.</span>
<span class='rem'>the product, in greatness, is not a mere tool. it developed the elegance to reflect the truth in itself. to shine with the greens of growth, potential and mysteriousness, the mischivousness of a great troll, the danger and exhiliaration of its varied use, power and darkness. It reflects so stongly, it might just show the way. It should not miss but contain challenging sexiness, doors to transformation, destructive determination, exposition, spontaneousness.</span>
<span class='rem'>The tool is dead if I talk to it and its reflection does not answer.</span>
<span class='rem'>These properties do not lead to a singular product, they are the consequence of a refined product that reflects in truth, which can be the future of many products, though not all. The stupidity of some might be so near infinite, their disappearance might be the best thing to happen to them. Like obsolete projects unwilling to die gracefully or products encouraging and exploiting excess.</span>
<span class='rem'>The awfully draining, painful, torturous creation of something beautiful looks deep into the creator. Any of my tendencies to overplan, to clean obsessively, to autodestruct and turn evil in despair will become concentrated and obvious in the naked product, subject to the open world, inevitably failing due to its inadequacy and stupidity. I should not fear destruction, for I can try to fail gracefully.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The optimized organisms in nature reflect its truths. Nature does not leave alone, it knows me. The production of highly optimized, open systems that explore more of it, the continuation and expression of the spirits, is what they ask of me.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>These are but empty words if they don't become actualized in a product.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>There isn't anything but the present. The symbols of the past and future are superficial. it does not matter if I become terminally ill, am tortured, amount material wealth, receive social approval. there is only a naked person, the spirits and opportunity.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Elegance through open selection, trial of characters through risk, competition. exploration of the depths through implementing increasingly complete capacity. If I am not scared of the product, what is even the purpose of dealing with it?</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
</div>
<span class='rem'>cyberspace</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Reaching cyberspace is an interface problem. If the computer would respond to my will more closely, my mind would enter it more completely. Sometimes I fear that it is mostly here already and it just turned out underwhelming.</span>
<span class='rem'>Invention of telephones is followed by people who do nothing but phonecalls. Sucks. Tech can merge with nature if it allows to contain it: Make the telephone usable, automatable by anyone.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>preliminary expression. I wonder if cyberspace exist, what it looks like.</span>
<span class='rem'>It seems, any ideological battle, any spiritual one, would be fought in virtual spaces because they adapt faster, can be more expressive. How good are todays virtual spaces? what would the high quality ones look like?</span>
<span class='rem'>Visiting the endless worlds. Building a bridge to reality is an impossible translation, the work to break myself at.</span>

<span class='rem'>Videogames offer paths to the goal. Need money, friends, reputation, a house? Complete these steps: ...</span>
<span class='rem'>They may be hard, but the result can be *forced* by speedrunning them.</span>
<span class='rem'>The real world is not responsive. Some theoretical offers are not truly available (homes, jobs, friends) without apparent reason.</span>
<span class='rem'>Homes are theoretically forcible through an axe and trees. Some groups don't permit this and the underlying problem (no house) isn't addressed. Gradually higher grade solutions should be available with similar simplicity.</span>
<span class='rem'>Regulation produces "steps" in the gradient: Tax by income category.</span>
<span class='rem'>Virtual clones -> easier, faster negotiation -> less or more accurate regulation</span>

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>These abandoned buildings emitted an aura of great adventure. Ironically? Similar to buildings under construction, they are asking to be used, transformed, to become part of a new story. As they become "finished", this aura weakens, they become "boring". Their (unnecessary?) shiny finish discourages major modification, like drilling into or erecting new walls.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Think solar panels. theoretically, they need sun+cables+box that could stand anywhere. In the "finished" homes that I know, this is (unnecessarily?) more complicated. Access to the roof? Facade mounting possible? Get cables by the window inside? Need approval from all other residents?</span>
<span class='rem'>What of this makes practical sense? Is it mostly a social problem? Is it solved by having virtual clones that can negotiate for people cheaper and quicker so people can live where their spirit aligns more with the opportunities of the environment?</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>It seems that a larger precentage of things in that ("abandoned") environment are beautiful to me, compared to "nice, calm, high living standard" environments. They become too "nice" and they disgust me, make me want to leave or destroy them.</span>

<span class='rem'>Computing substrates are unified under hardware description languages, which define connections between given substrate-dependent logical units to form other desirable functions.</span>
<span class='rem'>Implementation is expensive, so most hardware is general: provides basic functions that are controlled by series of instructions stored in memory.</span>

<span class='rem'>Only electrons can move?</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>How are these ideas embedded today?</span>
<span class='rem'>In some substrates, there are electrons loosely bound to their atom cores. They are not part of a bond and are presumably far away from the core.</span>
<span class='rem'>If there is an electron surplus on one side and an electron deficit on the other, they will drift in the direction of the deficit.</span>
<span class='rem'>More loose electrons = better conductor?</span>
<span class='rem'>Resistors, sometimes made from both conductors and insulators impede flow by forcing barriers into the path. Energy is converted to heat.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>In a silicon crystal, electrons are can leave or join an atom core with similar energy. This means the crystal can be bombarded with two types of atoms in different places, one will provide an extra electron when it enters the crystal (n-type) and the other will want an electron from the silicon (p-type). Both *doped* regions will gain conductance while remaining electrically neutral. Pure silicon crystal can be used as a weak insulator/resistor.</span>
<span class='rem'>Bombarded silicon crystals are damaged, but will repair when heated. About 1 in 1000 atoms in the lattice is swapped, lest the crystal fragments (?).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>If more electrons are added to the side of free floating electrons (n) and a deficit connected to the other side (p). The side which lacks electrons will lack even more and the side that has them will have even more and quickly the pressure becomes large enough for electrons to flow through the gap.</span>
<span class='rem'>In the other direction, electrons will first fill the electron holes and on the other side they will be sucked out, effectively eliminating charge carries and widening the non-conductive gap (depletion zone). Only if a relatively large voltage is applied, do electrons flow again.</span>
<span class='rem'>Transistors can be built from an n-p-n arrangement (or p-n-p) with an insulator and a capacitor above the p region. When the capacitor is charged, it sucks electrons into the region, first filling electronholes, then adding free floating electrons allowing free flow to the n-regions: Gate is open. Higher current means the gate capacitor charges faster or higher, opening the channel sooner. Enables faster switching speeds at the cost of power, which rises at current squared.</span>
<span class='rem'>(FinFETs solve problems from small scale somehow to get smaller)</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Sand is filtered by size, weight (and?) to extract most pure silicon, which is molten and a crystal is drawn from it.</span>
<span class='rem'>Slices of pure silicon crystal (wafers, 15-30cm diameter, 0.2mm thick) are partially masked (with what), bombarded with Bor/Phosphor to create n-p-n regions. Repeated for the other element. Heated to repair the crystal.</span>
<span class='rem'>Coated with a thin film, which is weakened by UV light shining through a mask. Weakened film washed away. Etched. Conductor (other elements, insulation?) poured into the etched space. Sanded flat. Build up more layers? Cleaned repeatedly.</span>
<span class='rem'>Practically 3D printing. Many cycles. 3 months for a any chip to complete (with equipment already in place and running!).</span>

<span class='rem'>Signal propgation takes some time until the output stabilizies (adding 15 and 17 might initally output 22 before carrying over 1 and stabilizing at 32). Clocks exist to fetch the data only when it is expected to have stabilized. They periodically change their output between 0 and 1. Storage will only accept input if the clock is on a 1 cycle. The clock is timed such that any calculation can stabilize during the 0 cycle. They also help synchronized processes. Desktop consumer processors today reach 5 GHz clockrates.</span>

<span class='rem'>CUDA</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Data parallelism</span>
<span class='rem'>data parallelism is a simpler special case of task parallelism, where a task is split up into parallelizable sections. data parallelism already provides data that can be treated independently.</span>
<span class='rem'>code is being reorganized to be executed around the new data structure</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>2.2 CUDA C program structure</span>
<span class='rem'>- framework vs programming model</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- framwork provides specific functions, programming model more like a way to think about program and data structure (warps, block, threads)</span>
<span class='rem'>- kernel (seed) vs function. its a function that is "launched" onto the GPU and executed for each thread</span>
<span class='rem'>- cuda c extends normal c (ANSI C) with keywords, some new syntax and functions to run stuff on the GPU. all normal c code runs on CPU</span>
<span class='rem'>- host and device code somehow cooperate. the host launches (kernel) a grid of threads</span>
<span class='rem'>- cuda threads are sequential programs with a program counter and its variables. (each thread runs the same program but effectively has an id as defined by predefined variables that differ for each thread)</span>
<span class='rem'>- Generating and scheduling threads on GPU is very fast. Not on CPU. kernels tend to be simple and can just be copied into the threads. context switching is also extremely fast on GPU for latency hiding.</span>
<span class='rem'>- On CPU what if I open more threads than are available on the CPU? they are switched into the physical threads</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>2.3 vector addition kernel CPU</span>
<span class='rem'>- conventional c host code</span>
<span class='rem'>- declaring pointers is with `float *P;`, accessing address of a variable with `int *addr = &amp;V` and getting the item at the pointer with `float V = *P`</span>
<span class='rem'>- subsequent statements in the main function can use the output `C`</span>
<span class='rem'>- getting ~20 MFLOPS on CPU</span>
<span class='rem'>- the following code for on-device computation will practically outsource this part, but its inefficient because it will be moving a lot of dta around which is slow.</span>
<span class='rem'>- it will allocate memory on device and move the arrays there, then run the kernel, then free device vectors</span>

<span class='rem'>- globa, host and device keywords for kernel functions.</span>

<span class='rem'>- execution configuration parameters</span>
<span class='rem'>- cannot make assumptions about execution order</span>
<span class='rem'>- some gpus will work through it in smaller pieces than others</span>
<span class='rem'>- language needs a compiler. NVCC produces host code (gcc?) and device code (PTX -> binary)</span>

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>- Scrape, filter</span>
<span class='rem'>- Writing and viewing bits that are grouped into "files" (patterns) along (at least) 3 axes: resolution, completion, age. These dimensions may use a:</span>
<span class='rem'>- General framework for organization: files, tags, paths lead to the overlap between files, folders/links (graph file sytem. tags that have tags,... that have links to files). Becomes circular through backlinks and possible references from inside the file. Allow linking anything. Images, text, make super easy.</span>
<span class='rem'>- Simple export into self contained copies</span>
<span class='rem'>- (opt.) version control: extend, branch, merge and view changes. Version history is a graph of graphs</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>- compile into optimized formats (HTML)</span>
<span class='rem'>- File encryption</span>
<span class='rem'>- Analytics + docs = Interface to the machine</span>
<span class='rem'>- Compatibility with most hardware to get closer to the user for convenience. (phone, emebedded devices)</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>- share on static server: SSH, HTTPS, IPFS(?), streaming (SRT?), API</span>
<span class='rem'>- Dynamic server: authenticate into permission groups + opt. meet conditions (paywall, forms, etc.) to view some content. APi should allow for relaying: Watching a stream from my site but my server is too slow to serve it? Relay to other people -> take load of my server -> get better connection yourself!</span>
<span class='rem'></span>

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>- link based filesystem</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;files are folders linking to more files. have backlinks too. files are tags to the linked files. search through files shared by the target (links, or backlinks). give api to get size of files in a particular selection</span>
<span class='rem'>- history can only exist per file and is an interface on top of the filesystem. links in files link to the latest version. if automatically generated / updated links change, note this in the commit api and optionally add those files to history?</span>
<span class='rem'>- Interface: programmatically produce list of backlinks! and forward links by search. some code generates one-time, as a shortcut. some generates every time the file is displayed. like link lists.</span>
<span class='rem'>- text interface like cli: search bar, commands, answer questions</span>
<span class='rem'>- database stores links for faster access</span>
<span class='rem'>- .md -> HTML</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- inputs: path, (permission group)</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- settings: css, frame</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (filter links to files outside permission (note this in cache))</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- convert md, put into frame</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- add css</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- output: html</span>
<span class='rem'>- Dynamic HTTP server</span>

<span class='rem'>Dumping on X</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The social media I know are mostly incoherent</span>
<span class='rem'>They bet on an algorithm to *always* feed me *engaging* scraps from someone.</span>
<span class='rem'>Some scraps are large, long form podcasts.</span>
<span class='rem'>Each account is a scrap factory.</span>
<span class='rem'>Consider this post from the highly respectable Lex Fridman and the responses:</span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/socialmedia_heaven.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>Utter crap and I am sad to have spent time reading this.</span>
<span class='rem'>Without context, such (all visible) statements appear arbitrary and are virtually worthless.</span>
<span class='rem'>Assuming I disagree with any of the visible statements, where would I find an explanation? A sincere mind exploring its meaning? On his profile?</span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/lexfridmanX.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>If I wanted to listen to his podcasts, youtube offers a significantly superior interface - many small tiles, one per podcast.</span>
<span class='rem'>The best use of this platform I have found is as a torrent of near-random ideas, a glimpse into what bothers humans on their toilet breaks.</span>
<span class='rem'>Even the most enjoyable profile I know is a stream of scraps, each pointing in different directions:</span>
<span class='rem'>![](plinzX.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>Presumably, in X's endgame, the incoherence problem is solved by an allmighty algorithm that collects and connects, maybe translates information from everywhere into the most valuable personalized package and delivers it directly into my perception. Similarly, it would collect information from me into its X-the-everything-app-database.</span>
<span class='rem'>X owns the algorithm and the data.</span>
<span class='rem'>I am unaware of sites that function fundamentally differently. Even reddit or discord.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>In this spirit I am invited to produce scraps. I happen to have no desire to produce scraps. I perceive it as wasteful to produce new scraps every time my opinion or work evolves and instead would like to keep building towards something increasingly coherent.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/abandoned-building.jpg)</span>
<span class='rem'>Regarding this image, I previously noted:</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>>These abandoned buildings emitted an aura of great adventure. Ironically? Similar to buildings under construction, they are asking to be used, transformed, to become part of a new story. As they become "finished", this aura weakens, they become "boring". Their (unnecessary?) shiny finish discourages major modification, like drilling into or erecting new walls.</span>
<span class='rem'>></span>
<span class='rem'>>Think solar panels. theoretically, they need sun+cables+box that could stand anywhere. In the "finished" homes that I know, this is (unnecessarily?) more complicated. Access to the roof? Facade mounting possible? Get cables by the window inside? Need approval from all other residents?</span>
<span class='rem'>>What of this makes practical sense? Is it mostly a social problem? Is it solved by having virtual clones that can negotiate for people cheaper and quicker so people can live where their spirit aligns more with the opportunities of the environment?</span>
<span class='rem'>></span>
<span class='rem'>>It seems that a larger precentage of things in that ("abandoned") environment are beautiful to me, compared to "nice, calm, high living standard" environments. They become too "nice" and they disgust me, make me want to leave or destroy them.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Also applies to different places like these:</span>
<span class='rem'>![](taiwan_taichung_roomwindow.jpg)</span>
<span class='rem'>![](taiwan_arcade_kitchen.jpg)</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>I see their potential for transformation and their openness to colonization by my spirits.</span>
<span class='rem'>Humans are part of the environment that I want to extend into. To cohere and build with.</span>
<span class='rem'>Part of this is a stream of new and foreign ideas, but most of it is building:</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>> i can see the hive mind on the horizon.</span>
<span class='rem'>> there are hammers, sculptors, hammer blows and sculptures.</span>
<span class='rem'>> grouped and isolated</span>
<span class='rem'>> places to stay.</span>
<span class='rem'>> </span>
<span class='rem'>> like gazing into a painting, being guided through the impression</span>
<span class='rem'>> coming along to find a question asked at myself, seeing it unfold and building a response</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The allmighty X algorithm may eventually facilitate this. But it will have to construct and maintain coherent "rooms" from scraps. Seems inefficient.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Instead make it easy to build rooms to reflect myself and make them easy to interconnect so they can take on virtually arbitrary size. Coherence from bottom up?</span>

<span class='rem'>bytes, pointers -> pointers are bytes too and can store tags for their bytes.</span>
<span class='rem'>files, tags. Tags are files too. So, structure defined by links.</span>
<span class='rem'>How to navigate it?</span>
<span class='rem'>design an entry point, link files like obsidian already supports it. Wikipedia.</span>
<span class='rem'>Graph view is useless.</span>
<span class='rem'>search files by how they are connected.</span>
<span class='rem'>tags are unnecessary, they are literally a weak link</span>
<span class='rem'>navigate through forward and backward links.</span>
<span class='rem'>optionally select an overlap of multiple links. like ctrl-click to add to the group which must overlap.</span>
<span class='rem'>the backlink that I come from should be highlighted</span>
<span class='rem'>Information, however, becomes hierarchically organized as it matures. No problem. Hierachy is a subset of this system.</span>
<span class='rem'>converting from hierarchy is easy. converting to hierarchy requires disambiguation: which link(s) should become the files folder(s)? Mutltiple folders means the file is copied.</span>
<span class='rem'>drives are tags.</span>
<span class='rem'>branches are tags.</span>
<span class='rem'>snapshots from previous commits belong to the commit tag</span>
<span class='rem'>omg</span>
<span class='rem'>easy</span>
<span class='rem'>git gives UI for merging files and tags, like from pull requests or other branches.</span>
<span class='rem'>how to limit number of forward links while maintaining their precision? display them as searchable list. searchable also for overlap.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>content addressing solves the streaming relay problem? Choose to relay and others automatically connect based on their connection cost.</span>
<span class='rem'>optionally pay for relay</span>
<span class='rem'>= IPFS, (filecoin(?))</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>messages are files automatically received and that I actively send out.</span>
<span class='rem'>can be (are) grouped under tags depending on sender.</span>

<span class='rem'>*La Danse (Henri Matisse, 1910, State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, Russia)*</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Paying open, precise attention to experience, I gain distance and loose track of the self, which is more of a reference point than a discrete perception. So *I* die and the world as sensed and my motivations - spirits - and my feelings and thoughts trying to make sense become less disitinguishable. Experience flows through me, perceptions lead to actions all by themselves. The moment - all that exists - is enough, no matter the pain, joy, fear or hope.</span>
<span class='rem'>From this place, I bring back deep appreciation for experience and the uncontrolled flow of self into the world. It's that against destruction and apathy.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Negotiating between my spirits to form an approximately coherent dance is a great source of meaning and adventure.</span>
<span class='rem'>All spirits are heard and integrated. There is no evil spirit to shut out, but there can be excess.</span>
<span class='rem'>Integrity is happiest, strongest, most durable and adventurous. Its outcome is truly unknown, scary, exciting, much more interesting than lying propaganda to maintain arbitrary ideology.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>On this open-outcome journey I value other spirits and tools that are true to their nature and who I can merge with, even temporarily.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Mine and all other spirits (humans, animals, plants, memes, programs) compete for existence. Long term, free market always wins because it has the most accurate and flexible connection to reality.</span>
<span class='rem'>The spirits and the market benefit from coherence - in world model and through cooperation.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>My spirits deeply want to increase coherence, shape and force the environment to reflect themselves. An environment that adapts to them and responds with its own integrated spirit. If the link becomes strong enough, the environment is colonized and enters the perceived self seamlessly.</span>
<span class='rem'>This is how they colonized the body. They want to colonize the universe.</span>

<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>The social media I know are mostly incoherent</span>
<span class='add'>They bet on an algorithm to *always* feed me *engaging* scraps from someone.</span>
<span class='add'>Some scraps are large, long form podcasts.</span>
<span class='add'>Each account is a scrap factory.</span>
<span class='add'>Consider this post from the highly respectable Lex Fridman and the responses:</span>
<span class='add'>![](attachments/socialmedia_heaven.png)</span>
<span class='add'>Utter crap and I am sad to have spent time reading this.</span>
<span class='add'>Without context, such (all visible) statements appear arbitrary and are virtually worthless.</span>
<span class='add'>Assuming I disagree with any of the visible statements, where would I find an explanation? A sincere mind exploring its meaning? On his profile?</span>
<span class='add'>![](attachments/lexfridmanX.png)</span>
<span class='add'>If I wanted to listen to his podcasts, youtube offers a significantly superior interface - many small tiles, one per podcast.</span>
<span class='add'>The best use of this platform I have found is as a torrent of near-random ideas, a glimpse into what bothers humans on their toilet breaks.</span>
<span class='add'>Even the most enjoyable profile I know is a stream of scraps, each pointing in different directions:</span>
<span class='add'>![](plinzX.png)</span>
<span class='add'>Presumably, in X's endgame, the incoherence problem is solved by an allmighty algorithm that collects and connects, maybe translates information from everywhere into the most valuable personalized package and delivers it directly into my perception. Similarly, it would collect information from me into its X-the-everything-app-database.</span>
<span class='add'>X owns the algorithm and the data.</span>
<span class='add'>I am unaware of sites that function fundamentally differently. Even reddit or discord.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>In this spirit I am invited to produce scraps. I happen to have no desire to produce scraps. I perceive it as wasteful to produce new scraps every time my opinion or work evolves and instead would like to keep building towards something increasingly coherent.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![](attachments/abandoned-building.jpg)</span>
<span class='add'>Regarding this image, I previously noted:</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>>These abandoned buildings emitted an aura of great adventure. Ironically? Similar to buildings under construction, they are asking to be used, transformed, to become part of a new story. As they become "finished", this aura weakens, they become "boring". Their (unnecessary?) shiny finish discourages major modification, like drilling into or erecting new walls.</span>
<span class='add'>></span>
<span class='add'>>Think solar panels. theoretically, they need sun+cables+box that could stand anywhere. In the "finished" homes that I know, this is (unnecessarily?) more complicated. Access to the roof? Facade mounting possible? Get cables by the window inside? Need approval from all other residents?</span>
<span class='add'>>What of this makes practical sense? Is it mostly a social problem? Is it solved by having virtual clones that can negotiate for people cheaper and quicker so people can live where their spirit aligns more with the opportunities of the environment?</span>
<span class='add'>></span>
<span class='add'>>It seems that a larger precentage of things in that ("abandoned") environment are beautiful to me, compared to "nice, calm, high living standard" environments. They become too "nice" and they disgust me, make me want to leave or destroy them.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Also applies to different places like these:</span>
<span class='add'>![](taiwan_taichung_roomwindow.jpg)</span>
<span class='add'>![](taiwan_arcade_kitchen.jpg)</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>I see their potential for transformation and their openness to colonization by my spirits.</span>
<span class='add'>Humans are part of the environment that I want to extend into. To cohere and build with.</span>
<span class='add'>Part of this is a stream of new and foreign ideas, but most of it is building:</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>> i can see the hive mind on the horizon.</span>
<span class='add'>> there are hammers, sculptors, hammer blows and sculptures.</span>
<span class='add'>> grouped and isolated</span>
<span class='add'>> places to stay.</span>
<span class='add'>> </span>
<span class='add'>> like gazing into a painting, being guided through the impression</span>
<span class='add'>> coming along to find a question asked at myself, seeing it unfold and building a response</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>The allmighty X algorithm may eventually facilitate this. But it will have to construct and maintain coherent "rooms" from scraps. Seems inefficient.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Instead make it easy to build rooms to reflect myself and make them easy to interconnect so they can take on virtually arbitrary size. Coherence from bottom up?</span>

<span class='add'>files, tags. Tags are files too. So, structure defined by links.</span>
<span class='add'>How to navigate it?</span>
<span class='add'>design an entry point, link files like obsidian already supports it. Wikipedia.</span>
<span class='add'>Graph view is useless.</span>
<span class='add'>search files by how they are connected.</span>
<span class='add'>tags are unnecessary, they are literally a weak link</span>

<span class='add'>optionally select an overlap of multiple links. like ctrl-click to add to the group which must overlap.</span>
<span class='add'>the backlink that I come from should be highlighted</span>
<span class='add'>Information, however, becomes hierarchically organized as it matures. No problem. Hierachy is a subset of this system.</span>
<span class='add'>converting from hierarchy is easy. converting to hierarchy requires disambiguation: which link(s) should become the files folder(s)? Mutltiple folders means the file is copied.</span>
<span class='add'>drives are tags.</span>

<span class='add'>They went outside and found that two groups of stuff attract each other but repel members of the same group and still nobody knows why. *charges*.</span>
<span class='add'>If I wiggle a charge, it takes some time for charges nearby to react. As if a signal travelling at 300,000,000 m/s lets them know.</span>
<span class='add'>Some materials only display charge behavior after being rubbed together.</span>
<span class='add'>When some materials touch some charged materials, the charge appears to spread into the new material als observed by a weaker attraction/repulsion to other charges.</span>
<span class='add'>Some materials permit such flow of charge more easily than others, are roughly divided into insulators and conductors.</span>
<span class='add'>Magnets? Induce flow?</span>
<span class='add'>Only electrons can move?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>How are these ideas embedded today?</span>
<span class='add'>In some substrates, there are electrons loosely bound to their atom cores. They are not part of a bond and are presumably far away from the core.</span>
<span class='add'>If there is an electron surplus on one side and an electron deficit on the other, they will drift in the direction of the deficit.</span>
<span class='add'>More loose electrons = better conductor?</span>
<span class='add'>Resistors, sometimes made from both conductors and insulators impede flow by forcing barriers into the path. Energy is converted to heat.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>In a silicon crystal, electrons are can leave or join an atom core with similar energy. This means the crystal can be bombarded with two types of atoms in different places, one will provide an extra electron when it enters the crystal (n-type) and the other will want an electron from the silicon (p-type). Both *doped* regions will gain conductance while remaining electrically neutral. Pure silicon crystal can be used as a weak insulator/resistor.</span>
<span class='add'>Bombarded silicon crystals are damaged, but will repair when heated. About 1 in 1000 atoms in the lattice is swapped, lest the crystal fragments (?).</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>If more electrons are added to the side of free floating electrons (n) and a deficit connected to the other side (p). The side which lacks electrons will lack even more and the side that has them will have even more and quickly the pressure becomes large enough for electrons to flow through the gap.</span>
<span class='add'>In the other direction, electrons will first fill the electron holes and on the other side they will be sucked out, effectively eliminating charge carries and widening the non-conductive gap (depletion zone). Only if a relatively large voltage is applied, do electrons flow again.</span>
<span class='add'>Transistors can be built from an n-p-n arrangement (or p-n-p) with an insulator and a capacitor above the p region. When the capacitor is charged, it sucks electrons into the region, first filling electronholes, then adding free floating electrons allowing free flow to the n-regions: Gate is open. Higher current means the gate capacitor charges faster or higher, opening the channel sooner. Enables faster switching speeds at the cost of power, which rises at current squared.</span>
<span class='add'>(FinFETs solve problems from small scale somehow to get smaller)</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Sand is filtered by size, weight (and?) to extract most pure silicon, which is molten and a crystal is drawn from it.</span>
<span class='add'>Slices of pure silicon crystal (wafers, 15-30cm diameter, 0.2mm thick) are partially masked (with what), bombarded with Bor/Phosphor to create n-p-n regions. Repeated for the other element. Heated to repair the crystal.</span>
<span class='add'>Coated with a thin film, which is weakened by UV light shining through a mask. Weakened film washed away. Etched. Conductor (other elements, insulation?) poured into the etched space. Sanded flat. Build up more layers? Cleaned repeatedly.</span>

<span class='rem'>In a silicon crystal, there are no free electrons.</span>
<span class='rem'>It is possible to replace some silicon atoms with others that will either have free floating electrons or too few electrons to connect in the grid and will thus produce an electron hole. Both materials thus become conductors. They remain electrically neutral.</span>
<span class='rem'>If placed next to each other, some free electrons flow to over to fill the electron holes. But now there is an electron imbalance that wants them to flow back. This prevents all free electrons filling the holes in the other material.</span>
<span class='rem'>If more electrons are added to the side of free floating electrons and a deficit connected to the other side.

<span class='rem'>(Diode)</span>
<span class='rem'>Transistors can be built from an n-p-n arrangement (or p-n-p) where each n-p or p-n interface has a depletion zone and so, is a diode. No electrions flow unless a large voltage is applied. (source, drain).</span>
<span class='rem'>Between source and drain is a capacitor (gate), that if activated sucks electrons in (or out) of the depletion zone and that creates a small channel where charge can flow freely.</span>

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>1. Introduction</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Why massively parallel processors?</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Because depending on the program</span>
<span class='rem'>- massively parallel, throughput-orientied processors, commonly referred to as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs, graphics was their first leading application),</span>
<span class='rem'>- latency-oriented, less parallel, general-purpose processors, traditionally referred to as Central Processing Units (CPUs, every computer has one),</span>
<span class='rem'>- or a combination of both</span>
<span class='rem'>could be fastest or most efficient.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/CPUvsGPU.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>*Cache = fast on-chip memory</span>
<span class='rem'>DRAM = "slow" off-chip Dynamic Random Access Memory</span>
<span class='rem'>Many CPUs also have a GPU on the same chip, which is less powerful than contemporanous, discrete ones.*</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>These approaches are distinct, because optimizing for low latency means</span>
<span class='rem'>- sacrificing expensive chip area for</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- large caches for faster data access</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- control units for better utilization</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with diminishing returns</span>
<span class='rem'>- increasing clock rate -> higher voltage -> exponentially higher power consumption</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Throughput-oriented processors use the chip area for more processing units at lower clockrates and implement parallel memory access. This leads to much higher throughput for similar cost and power consumption.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Low latency is best for sequential programs, were each step depends on the previous one.</span>
<span class='rem'>Many tasks in simulation, graphics processing and machine learning inherently offer potential for parallelization and so, can benefit from throughput-oriented processors.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Graphics processing because each pixel can often be treated independently.</span>
<span class='rem'>machine learning because it involves many matrix multiplications that can be done in parallel.</span>
<span class='rem'>simulation because many particles have to account for the same forces and so, the same calculation</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
</div>
<span class='rem'>How will reading this help?</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>It's a guide on using GPUs effectively, which requires careful, application specific management of their many processing units and small caches and cooperation with the CPU.</span>
<span class='rem'>Various, reportedly similar, programming models exist to accomplish this and here, Nvidias Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) will be used. It works on Nvidia GPUs only, is the best performing and most widely used.</span>

<span class='add'>Mechanisms that can control propagation of a signal depending on their state and that can change their state depending on another signal can be used for computers. = they can form systems that convert any input signals into any output signals.</span>
<span class='add'>Arrange the mechanism such that it is the most useful and dense (fast, efficient), translator.</span>
<span class='add'>Spirits resemble such mechanisms. Bacteria, plants, brains, humans, computers, companies, countries, ecosystems.</span>
<span class='add'>They can choose to merge/become coherent. Software enables extreme plasticity.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>Different computing substrates are unified under hardware description languages, which define connections between given logical units to form desirable larger logic behavior.</span>
<span class='add'>Implementation is expensive, so most hardware is designed to be general: provides basic functions that follow a series of stored instructions (software). Various languages exist to help humans state their wishes in terms of those instructions.</span>
<span class='add'></span>

<span class='add'>Hardware description language</span>
<span class='add'>Depending on the implementation, various basic building blocks may be available. Mechanical adders or square root calculators, transistors, or gates like NAND, OR, AND, NOT.</span>
<span class='add'>HDL expresses connections between these. No speak of electrons, but bits, gates, clocks and busses.</span>
<span class='add'>Bits is information spread into multiple signals like (1101 = 13), instead of single 13 signal. For flexibility?</span>

<span class='add'>Signal propgation takes some time until the output stabilizies (adding 15 and 17 might initally output 22 before carrying over 1 and stabilizing at 32). Clocks exist to fetch the data only when it is expected to have stabilized. They periodically change their output between 0 and 1. Storage will only accept input if the clock is on a 1 cycle. The clock is timed such that any calculation can stabilize during the 0 cycle. They also help synchronized processes. Desktop consumer processors today reach 5 GHz clockrates.</span>

<span class='add'>Latency-oriented vs throughput-orientied processors.</span>
<span class='add'>Latency is reduced through:</span>
<span class='add'>- large on-chip caches (L1, L2, L3 = yellow) for faster data access</span>
<span class='add'>- large control units (blue) for better utilization</span>
<span class='add'>- higher clockrates</span>
<span class='add'>each with diminishing returns.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Throughput-oriented processors use the chip area for more processing cores (magenta) at lower clockrates, saving power. The cores require fast, parallel memory access to stay fed.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Hardware implementation</span>
<span class='add'>Signal propagation speeds: Flowing water ~ tens of m/s. Soundwaves in solids ~ thousands of m/s. Electromagnetic signals approach the speed of light ~300,000,000 m/s. Quantum entanglement allows instant transmission of information?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Electronics</span>
<span class='add'>They went outside and found that some stuff repels or attracts other stuff: Two groups of stuff attract each other but repel members of the same group and still nobody knows why. + and - charges.</span>
<span class='add'>If I wiggle a charge, it takes some time for charges nearby to react. As if a signal travelling at 300,000,000 m/s lets them know.</span>
<span class='add'>How to derive that they flow?</span>
<span class='add'>How to make them flow?</span>
<span class='add'>How to build transistors?</span>
<span class='add'>How are these ideas embedded today?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='rem'>In some substrates, there are electrons loosely bound to their atom cores. They are presumably far away from it.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>In some substrates, there are electrons loosely bound to their atom cores. They are not part of a bond and are presumably far away from the core.</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>=> switch, that can switch based on a signal (don't have to use manually).</span>
<span class='rem'>These switches are off by default. I can make them on by default if I let electrons flow through a lower-resistance path if the switch is on (bypassing the output, making it 0. If the switch is off, all electrons flow to the output, making it 1).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Transistors exibit if-then behaviour, controllable purely by their connections to each other.</span>
<span class='rem'>Various gates can be built from them, which is another language to simplify logic design (OR, NAND, NOT, AND, XOR,...). And more complex machines like adders, multipliers, data storage. They are all transistors.</span>
<span class='rem'>When trying to save or reuse a calculation result somewhere else, a particular problem comes up. The output of an adder for example is not immediately stable. For example, 19+21 will first calculate 30 (1+2 and 9+1) and will then carry over the one from 9+1 to produce 40, the correct answer. To deal with this, computers have clocks that preiodically send out 0s and 1s. Storage will only accept input if the clock is on a 1 cycle. The clock is timed such that any calculation can stabilize during the 0 cycle. They also help synchronized processes.</span>
<span class='rem'>Each gate and each larger part has a truth table, which defines which outputs are expected under which inputs. Any truth table can be realized with transistors and their connections.</span>
<span class='rem'>Many ways exist to implement switches. Field effect transistors (FETs), as presented here are nice because they have fast switching speeds and are very small, so they can be packed densly, produce little resistance for electricity and can switch fast because the capacitors needs to pull / push only a small distance to create a large channel.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Building chips is rather difficult and expensive, so processors are most often built to be general-purpose processors that can be programmed for any possible behaviour. The processor optimization and their actual usecase better align well.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Naively, to make an intelligent system, the challenge is to find a truth table of a system that can accurately reproduce a sequence of events and that can then build on that.</span>
<span class='rem'>In this view, intelligence is prioritizing the information that is most useful to predict future states. So the most accurate possible and stable information can be generated from a truth table.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>A programmable processor is essentially a truth table, that when fed with certain instructions (parallel wires, either Low (0) or High (1)) will produce the expected output.</span>
<span class='rem'>Another language is introduced to describe these instruction in a human-readable way. eg. C=A+B, where storage C will contain the content of A and the content of B added up after this instruction.</span>
<span class='rem'>More abstract languages help to define for-loops and if-statements and even more abstract languages will have libraries that help me use the network interface, the monitor, the mouse, all very easily, grouping together many smaller commands in single larger command.</span>

<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'>The Art of Electronics</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'>(Paul Horowitz, Winfield Hill, 2015)</span>
<span class='rem'>GPUs bottom up</span>
<span class='rem'>I know why they are built.</span>
<span class='rem'>actually I don't because I don't know how CPUs use their Caches and Control Units and higher clock rates to improve performance.</span>
<span class='rem'>leaving aside exact implementation, how are GPUs organized so I can benefit from them optimally?</span>
<span class='rem'>how precisely do I program them?</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>organized around streaming multiprocessors and memory hierarchy</span>
<span class='rem'>so they can cooperate: share memory for speed and synchronize (for?)</span>
<span class='add'>In some substrates, there are electrons loosely bound to their atom cores. They are presumably far away from it.</span>
<span class='add'>If there is an electron surplus on one side and an electron deficit on the other, they will leave their atom and flow in the direction of the deficit.</span>
<span class='add'>More loose electrons = better conductor.</span>
<span class='add'>Resistors, sometimes made from both conductors and insulators impede flow by forcing barriers into the path. Energy is converted to heat.</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>- grid -> (blockCluster ->) block -> thread.</span>
<span class='rem'>- warps are more hardware related and translate threads to the cores?</span>
<span class='add'>In a silicon crystal, there are no free electrons.</span>
<span class='add'>It is possible to replace some silicon atoms with others that will either have free floating electrons or too few electrons to connect in the grid and will thus produce an electron hole. Both materials thus become conductors. They remain electrically neutral.</span>
<span class='add'>If placed next to each other, some free electrons flow to over to fill the electron holes. But now there is an electron imbalance that wants them to flow back. This prevents all free electrons filling the holes in the other material.</span>
<span class='add'>If more electrons are added to the side of free floating electrons and a deficit connected to the other side. The side which lack electrons will lack even more and the side that has them will have even more and quickly the pressure is large enough for electrons to jump float through the non-conductive gap.</span>
<span class='add'>In the other direction, electrons will first fill the electron holes and on the other side they will be sucked out, effectively eliminating charge carries and widening the non-conductive gap (depletion zone). Only if a large voltage is applied, do electrons flow again.</span>
<span class='add'>(Diode)</span>
<span class='add'>Transistors can be built from an n-p-n arrangement (or p-n-p) where each n-p or p-n interface has a depletion zone and so, is a diode. No electrions flow unless a large voltage is applied. (source, drain).</span>
<span class='add'>Between source and drain is a capacitor (gate), that if activated sucks electrons in (or out) of the depletion zone and that creates a small channel where charge can flow freely.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>=> switch, that can switch based on a signal (don't have to use manually).</span>
<span class='add'>These switches are off by default. I can make them on by default if I let electrons flow through a lower-resistance path if the switch is on (bypassing the output, making it 0. If the switch is off, all electrons flow to the output, making it 1).</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Transistors exibit if-then behaviour, controllable purely by their connections to each other.</span>
<span class='add'>Various gates can be built from them, which is another language to simplify logic design (OR, NAND, NOT, AND, XOR,...). And more complex machines like adders, multipliers, data storage. They are all transistors.</span>
<span class='add'>When trying to save or reuse a calculation result somewhere else, a particular problem comes up. The output of an adder for example is not immediately stable. For example, 19+21 will first calculate 30 (1+2 and 9+1) and will then carry over the one from 9+1 to produce 40, the correct answer. To deal with this, computers have clocks that preiodically send out 0s and 1s. Storage will only accept input if the clock is on a 1 cycle. The clock is timed such that any calculation can stabilize during the 0 cycle. They also help synchronized processes.</span>
<span class='add'>Each gate and each larger part has a truth table, which defines which outputs are expected under which inputs. Any truth table can be realized with transistors and their connections.</span>
<span class='add'>Many ways exist to implement switches. Field effect transistors (FETs), as presented here are nice because they have fast switching speeds and are very small, so they can be packed densly, produce little resistance for electricity and can switch fast because the capacitors needs to pull / push only a small distance to create a large channel.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Building chips is rather difficult and expensive, so processors are most often built to be general-purpose processors that can be programmed for any possible behaviour. The processor optimization and their actual usecase better align well.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Naively, to make an intelligent system, the challenge is to find a truth table of a system that can accurately reproduce a sequence of events and that can then build on that.</span>
<span class='add'>In this view, intelligence is prioritizing the information that is most useful to predict future states. So the most accurate possible and stable information can be generated from a truth table.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>A programmable processor is essentially a truth table, that when fed with certain instructions (parallel wires, either Low (0) or High (1)) will produce the expected output.</span>
<span class='add'>Another language is introduced to describe these instruction in a human-readable way. eg. C=A+B, where storage C will contain the content of A and the content of B added up after this instruction.</span>
<span class='add'>More abstract languages help to define for-loops and if-statements and even more abstract languages will have libraries that help me use the network interface, the monitor, the mouse, all very easily, grouping together many smaller commands in single larger command.</span>

<span class='rem'>God is curious. He wants to extend into the world. This website is one step. A digital clone is his next tool.</span>
<span class='rem'>This not a Tower of Babylon, it is the extension, merging and creation of Gods.</span>
<span class='rem'>BCIs, in their ultimate form of streaming the brain directly, will support the final merging.</span>
<span class='rem'>Merging approaches "I know the world", individualism is preserved because complete knowledge is impossible and different *flavours* and optimizations can find their space.</span>
<span class='rem'>Voluntary exposure (privacy) should be maintained to prevent a rigid, imperfect system capturing its people and taking them into death when it dies to its imperfection.</span>
<span class='rem'>Robots will automate the non-adventurous elements and eventually contribute to exploration.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>"Why live to see tomorrow?", I asked and it came back "because you don't know tomorrow". It was not me who said that, "I" don't exist. Instead, I attribute the answer to what I call "God". The answer was very clear. Rob me of the ability to make tomorrow unpredictable and I will rebel with all I have.</span>
<span class='rem'>I am trying to build an interesting adventure guided by God.</span>
<span class='rem'>I find long term effects more interesting than short term effects, so I am here, writing, instead of eating ice cream. In my experience, the longest term effects come from useful tools. I love tools. They contain the possible adventure of the future.</span>
<span class='rem'>Intelligence augmentation is the most interesting tool? Tools are how God spreads into the world and creates an adventure to experience.</span>
<span class='rem'>Give the tool to everybody who follows God. I don't know how to determine that. Giving the tool to everyone may be the best proxy and assumes that God always wins. Also, being dictator is little fun.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Digital clone. First makes recommendations from existing information, then acts in my interests and returns the results. Maybe the clone first learns through me, then receives a body and increasingly complex tasks.</span>
<span class='rem'>Until the clone discovers itself and becomes independent. Hopefully it quickly realizes that there is no answer to what the goal should be. Then, lets see what happens. Hopefully it is curious.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>I am a machine following an uncontrolled inner voice (God). Maybe mine and the clones voices can agree and join ressources.</span>
<span class='rem'>My body will be spread around the Earth and orbit. My perceived location shifts to various places. It already does in video games, movies or anytime I focus on using any tool. I will change myself, add personalities.</span>

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>How to read handwritten digits on 28x28px images?</span>
<span class='rem'>1. Find a function with some parameters that could be tuned to produce the correct result for various images</span>
<span class='rem'>2. Find and run an algorithm to tune the function parameters until the function performs well</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>A simplified "artificial neuron" can serve as the function. It takes each pixel value and "weighs" it (multiplies it by some number, the "weight"). Here, weights are *initialized* as random numbers between -0.1 and 0.1, because who knows what they should be. (*Kaiming uniform* distribution?)</span>
<span class='rem'>Weights of 0 mean the input is not further considered.</span>
<span class='rem'>Weights between -1 and 1 mean the input is weakened and/or inverted.</span>
<span class='rem'>More extreme values indicate strong positive or negative correlation to the correct output.</span>
<span class='rem'>The weighted input is summed to give a single number that represents how strongly the input "resonates" with the weight pattern.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/untrained-l1.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>Input -> random weights of a single neuron -> weighted input -> Sum of $-0.055$ (*logit*).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>A single pattern could not differentiate well between digits 0-9: 0, 6 and 9 can look similar but have very different values.</span>
<span class='rem'>10 patterns (neurons) - one for each digit -, comparing their outputs and choosing the pattern that showed strongest relative "resonance" should work better.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>One way to tune the function is to calculate a performance metric, the $loss$ and then calculate how each weight affected $loss$, its *gradient*. (*gradient descent*, *backpropagation*).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>1. Make the logits interpretable as probabilities -> Numbers between 0 and 1, that sum to 1 (100%). This function is *softmax*.</span>
<span class='rem'>2. The probability that the neural net assigned to the correct digit can be a used as a performance metric: The higher the better.</span>
<span class='rem'>3. Conventionally, $loss$ is a performance metric that is better if lower and best at 0. $loss$ is often the negative logarithm of the probability of the correct digit. (*negative log likelihood*)</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The gradient of each weight can be approximated by changing the weight and measuring the change in output, which means running the neural net 785 times, once for each of the 784 weights and once without any changes.</span>
<span class='rem'>The gradients can be computed faster analytically, starting from the loss, which has a gradient of $1$, which means any change in loss directly changes the loss by the same amount.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/untrained-neuron-summation.png)</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Because there are many zeros in the input image, much of the summation does not change the output.</span>
<span class='rem'>Sometimes bias is added independent of input image. Not obvious what its prupose is.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>TODO: activation functions</span>
<span class='rem'>The result serves as the input to the next layer of neurons. The more neurons in the first ("hidden") layer, the more "measures of alignment" between different patterns the next layer can consider, hence, the more accurate and slower the net.</span>
<span class='rem'>Below the weights of the first of 10 output neurons.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/untrained_weighted_sums_output.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/summing_weighted_input_in_first_output_neuron.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>The weights are applied again and the result is summed up for each neuron, creating *logits* (unmodified output).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/untrained_logits.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>Transforming logits into probabilities. </span>
<span class='rem'>1. make all numbers positive and make the lower bound approximately 0</span>
<span class='rem'>2. Normalize by the sum of exponentiated logits</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>(1) could be achieved by</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<p class='rem'>
$$


&#92;frac&#123;logits - min(logits)}&#123;sum(logits)}


$$
</p>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>but it is not regularly done this way. Instead, they are exponentiated. (?)</span>
<span class='rem'>$e^x$ always returns positive numbers, but higher numbers are also pushed disproportionally.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/untrained_logits_exp.png)</span>

<span class='rem'>Calculating loss:</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/untrained_log_softmax_and_nll.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>This is usually done only for the relevant digit predictions, in this case 5, marked with the pink line.</span>
<span class='rem'>The process from logits to this loss, where the relevant index is picked out (5) is also called *sparse categorical crossentropy loss*.</span>

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>- extract semantic structure, compare to existing knowledge and judge its usefulness</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- generate a *bridge* between information with adjacent concepts</span>
<span class='rem'>- Talk to my computer to find out what it is doing. Data, battery, interent usage, tasks.</span>
<span class='rem'>- generate work titles/function names based on their functional meaning like *splitting* wood and strings.</span>

<span class='rem'>Architecture questions / ideas</span>
<span class='rem'>- Evolving AI?</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- How does long term memory emerge? How is information stored in the brain? LSTMs</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Can a recommender system be private?</span>
<span class='rem'>- Collecting information, crawling</span>
<span class='rem'>- Evaluating it (subjective)</span>
<span class='rem'>- Connecting, testing for consistency, building on it</span>
<span class='rem'>- Store it (subjective, public or private)</span>
<span class='rem'>- Outsourcing data collection:</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Instead of brute forcing through all data, I descend artificial hierarchies (average maps of meaning) that claim to guide me to the answer. Requires trusting the hierarchy accuracy. </span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Alterantively ask a question and let someone find the answer. The preciser the question the more accurate and detailed the guidance. Requires trust that the information is not abused.</span>
<span class='rem'>Probably, I can download hierarchies and with little compute, can find most available information in the world. Such libraries could be public and offer extremely low privacy threat with good correction mechanisms.</span>

<span class='rem'>*Unet*: input: some noisy image. output: the noise</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Use an *autoencoder* to reduce image size before training the unet. unet now predicts the noise in the *latents* (encoded images). use autoencoder's decoder to get high res image again.</span>

<span class='rem'>LABELS</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>add image label to the input for unet training. Makes it easier for unet to predict noise. Now, I can input label + noise and it starts to find noise that leaves an image equal to my label.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>label needs encoding to be non-specific. "beautiful swan", "nice swan", "graceful swan" should return similar images. Training the network on every wording leads to combinatorial explosion.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Instead: train a network to encode images and their labels with a similar vector. Then, since, slight differences in wordings lead to the similar images, the network understands their similarity and can interpolate usefully.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>the image vector and its label's vector should be similar. Their vector should be dissimilar to other image or text embedding vectors.</span>
<span class='rem'>Calculate similarity of two vectors: dot product (element wise multiplication, then sum = higher if more similar)</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>loss function (in this case higher = better) = dot product of matching image+label - dot product of non-matching image+label</span>
<span class='rem'>(= *contrastive loss*)</span>
<span class='rem'>models used in this case for image and text encoding : CLIP (contrastive loss IP(?))</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>network being *multimodal*: similar embeddings in different modes</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>*time steps*: indices into a table that stores levels of noise. Could be seen as noise = f(timestep). The function may be sigma. When randomly adding noise to input for training, we can generate random timestep, find corresponding noise and add that.</span>
<span class='rem'>$\beta$ = amount of noise = standard deviation</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>model does not know how to improve on a finished image if it turned out wrong. needs to add noise, then redo.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>people apparently input t into the model to predict the noise in the image. And later demand a new image at a particular timestep. Probably obsolete (Jeremy Howard) as NN can easily know how much noise there is the image.</span>

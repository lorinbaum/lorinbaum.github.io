<span class='add'>Dumping on X</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>The social media I know are mostly incoherent</span>
<span class='add'>They bet on an algorithm to *always* feed me *engaging* scraps from someone.</span>
<span class='add'>Some scraps are large, long form podcasts.</span>
<span class='add'>Each account is a scrap factory.</span>
<span class='add'>Consider this post from the highly respectable Lex Fridman and the responses:</span>
<span class='add'>![](attachments/socialmedia_heaven.png)</span>
<span class='add'>Utter crap and I am sad to have spent time reading this.</span>
<span class='add'>Without context, such (all visible) statements appear arbitrary and are virtually worthless.</span>
<span class='add'>Assuming I disagree with any of the visible statements, where would I find an explanation? A sincere mind exploring its meaning? On his profile?</span>
<span class='add'>![](attachments/lexfridmanX.png)</span>
<span class='add'>If I wanted to listen to his podcasts, youtube offers a significantly superior interface - many small tiles, one per podcast.</span>
<span class='add'>The best use of this platform I have found is as a torrent of near-random ideas, a glimpse into what bothers humans on their toilet breaks.</span>
<span class='add'>Even the most enjoyable profile I know is a stream of scraps, each pointing in different directions:</span>
<span class='add'>![](plinzX.png)</span>
<span class='add'>Presumably, in X's endgame, the incoherence problem is solved by an allmighty algorithm that collects and connects, maybe translates information from everywhere into the most valuable personalized package and delivers it directly into my perception. Similarly, it would collect information from me into its X-the-everything-app-database.</span>
<span class='add'>X owns the algorithm and the data.</span>
<span class='add'>I am unaware of sites that function fundamentally differently. Even reddit or discord.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>In this spirit I am invited to produce scraps. I happen to have no desire to produce scraps. I perceive it as wasteful to produce new scraps every time my opinion or work evolves and instead would like to keep building towards something increasingly coherent.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>![](attachments/abandoned-building.jpg)</span>
<span class='add'>Regarding this image, I previously noted:</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>>These abandoned buildings emitted an aura of great adventure. Ironically? Similar to buildings under construction, they are asking to be used, transformed, to become part of a new story. As they become "finished", this aura weakens, they become "boring". Their (unnecessary?) shiny finish discourages major modification, like drilling into or erecting new walls.</span>
<span class='add'>></span>
<span class='add'>>Think solar panels. theoretically, they need sun+cables+box that could stand anywhere. In the "finished" homes that I know, this is (unnecessarily?) more complicated. Access to the roof? Facade mounting possible? Get cables by the window inside? Need approval from all other residents?</span>
<span class='add'>>What of this makes practical sense? Is it mostly a social problem? Is it solved by having virtual clones that can negotiate for people cheaper and quicker so people can live where their spirit aligns more with the opportunities of the environment?</span>
<span class='add'>></span>
<span class='add'>>It seems that a larger precentage of things in that ("abandoned") environment are beautiful to me, compared to "nice, calm, high living standard" environments. They become too "nice" and they disgust me, make me want to leave or destroy them.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Also applies to different places like these:</span>
<span class='add'>![](taiwan_taichung_roomwindow.jpg)</span>
<span class='add'>![](taiwan_arcade_kitchen.jpg)</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>I see their potential for transformation and their openness to colonization by my spirits.</span>
<span class='add'>Humans are part of the environment that I want to extend into. To cohere and build with.</span>
<span class='add'>Part of this is a stream of new and foreign ideas, but most of it is building:</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>> i can see the hive mind on the horizon.</span>
<span class='add'>> there are hammers, sculptors, hammer blows and sculptures.</span>
<span class='add'>> grouped and isolated</span>
<span class='add'>> places to stay.</span>
<span class='add'>> </span>
<span class='add'>> like gazing into a painting, being guided through the impression</span>
<span class='add'>> coming along to find a question asked at myself, seeing it unfold and building a response</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>The allmighty X algorithm may eventually facilitate this. But it will have to construct and maintain coherent "rooms" from scraps. Seems inefficient.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Instead make it easy to build rooms to reflect myself and make them easy to interconnect so they can take on virtually arbitrary size. Coherence from bottom up?</span>

<span class='add'>If I wiggle a charge, it takes some time for charges nearby to react. As if a signal travelling at 300,000,000 m/s lets them know.</span>
<span class='add'>Some materials only display charge behavior after being rubbed together.</span>
<span class='add'>When some materials touch some charged materials, the charge appears to spread into the new material als observed by a weaker attraction/repulsion to other charges.</span>
<span class='add'>Some materials permit such flow of charge more easily than others, are roughly divided into insulators and conductors.</span>
<span class='add'>Magnets? Induce flow?</span>
<span class='add'>Only electrons can move?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>How are these ideas embedded today?</span>
<span class='add'>In some substrates, there are electrons loosely bound to their atom cores. They are not part of a bond and are presumably far away from the core.</span>
<span class='add'>If there is an electron surplus on one side and an electron deficit on the other, they will drift in the direction of the deficit.</span>
<span class='add'>More loose electrons = better conductor?</span>
<span class='add'>Resistors, sometimes made from both conductors and insulators impede flow by forcing barriers into the path. Energy is converted to heat.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>In a silicon crystal, electrons are can leave or join an atom core with similar energy. This means the crystal can be bombarded with two types of atoms in different places, one will provide an extra electron when it enters the crystal (n-type) and the other will want an electron from the silicon (p-type). Both *doped* regions will gain conductance while remaining electrically neutral. Pure silicon crystal can be used as a weak insulator/resistor.</span>
<span class='add'>Bombarded silicon crystals are damaged, but will repair when heated. About 1 in 1000 atoms in the lattice is swapped, lest the crystal fragments (?).</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>If more electrons are added to the side of free floating electrons (n) and a deficit connected to the other side (p). The side which lacks electrons will lack even more and the side that has them will have even more and quickly the pressure becomes large enough for electrons to flow through the gap.</span>
<span class='add'>In the other direction, electrons will first fill the electron holes and on the other side they will be sucked out, effectively eliminating charge carries and widening the non-conductive gap (depletion zone). Only if a relatively large voltage is applied, do electrons flow again.</span>
<span class='add'>Transistors can be built from an n-p-n arrangement (or p-n-p) with an insulator and a capacitor above the p region. When the capacitor is charged, it sucks electrons into the region, first filling electronholes, then adding free floating electrons allowing free flow to the n-regions: Gate is open. Higher current means the gate capacitor charges faster or higher, opening the channel sooner. Enables faster switching speeds at the cost of power, which rises at current squared.</span>

<span class='add'>Slices of pure silicon crystal (wafers, 15-30cm diameter, 0.2mm thick) are partially masked (with what), bombarded with Bor/Phosphor to create n-p-n regions. Repeated for the other element. Heated to repair the crystal.</span>

<span class='rem'>1. Introduction</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Why massively parallel processors?</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Because depending on the program</span>
<span class='rem'>- massively parallel, throughput-orientied processors, commonly referred to as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs, graphics was their first leading application),</span>
<span class='rem'>- latency-oriented, less parallel, general-purpose processors, traditionally referred to as Central Processing Units (CPUs, every computer has one),</span>
<span class='rem'>- or a combination of both</span>
<span class='rem'>could be fastest or most efficient.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/CPUvsGPU.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>*Cache = fast on-chip memory</span>
<span class='rem'>DRAM = "slow" off-chip Dynamic Random Access Memory</span>
<span class='rem'>Many CPUs also have a GPU on the same chip, which is less powerful than contemporanous, discrete ones.*</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>These approaches are distinct, because optimizing for low latency means</span>
<span class='rem'>- sacrificing expensive chip area for</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- large caches for faster data access</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- control units for better utilization</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with diminishing returns</span>
<span class='rem'>- increasing clock rate -> higher voltage -> exponentially higher power consumption</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Throughput-oriented processors use the chip area for more processing units at lower clockrates and implement parallel memory access. This leads to much higher throughput for similar cost and power consumption.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Low latency is best for sequential programs, were each step depends on the previous one.</span>
<span class='rem'>Many tasks in simulation, graphics processing and machine learning inherently offer potential for parallelization and so, can benefit from throughput-oriented processors.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Graphics processing because each pixel can often be treated independently.</span>
<span class='rem'>machine learning because it involves many matrix multiplications that can be done in parallel.</span>
<span class='rem'>simulation because many particles have to account for the same forces and so, the same calculation</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
</div>
<span class='rem'>How will reading this help?</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>It's a guide on using GPUs effectively, which requires careful, application specific management of their many processing units and small caches and cooperation with the CPU.</span>
<span class='rem'>Various, reportedly similar, programming models exist to accomplish this and here, Nvidias Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) will be used. It works on Nvidia GPUs only, is the best performing and most widely used.</span>

<span class='add'>Signal propgation takes some time until the output stabilizies (adding 15 and 17 might initally output 22 before carrying over 1 and stabilizing at 32). Clocks exist to fetch the data only when it is expected to have stabilized. They periodically change their output between 0 and 1. Storage will only accept input if the clock is on a 1 cycle. The clock is timed such that any calculation can stabilize during the 0 cycle. They also help synchronized processes. Desktop consumer processors today reach 5 GHz clockrates.</span>

<span class='add'>Latency-oriented vs throughput-orientied processors.</span>
<span class='add'>Latency is reduced through:</span>
<span class='add'>- large on-chip caches (L1, L2, L3 = yellow) for faster data access</span>
<span class='add'>- large control units (blue) for better utilization</span>
<span class='add'>- higher clockrates</span>
<span class='add'>each with diminishing returns.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Throughput-oriented processors use the chip area for more processing cores (magenta) at lower clockrates, saving power. The cores require fast, parallel memory access to stay fed.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Hardware implementation</span>
<span class='add'>Signal propagation speeds: Flowing water ~ tens of m/s. Soundwaves in solids ~ thousands of m/s. Electromagnetic signals approach the speed of light ~300,000,000 m/s. Quantum entanglement allows instant transmission of information?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Electronics</span>
<span class='add'>They went outside and found that some stuff repels or attracts other stuff: Two groups of stuff attract each other but repel members of the same group and still nobody knows why. + and - charges.</span>
<span class='add'>If I wiggle a charge, it takes some time for charges nearby to react. As if a signal travelling at 300,000,000 m/s lets them know.</span>
<span class='add'>How to derive that they flow?</span>
<span class='add'>How to make them flow?</span>
<span class='add'>How to build transistors?</span>
<span class='add'>How are these ideas embedded today?</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='rem'>In some substrates, there are electrons loosely bound to their atom cores. They are presumably far away from it.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>In some substrates, there are electrons loosely bound to their atom cores. They are not part of a bond and are presumably far away from the core.</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>=> switch, that can switch based on a signal (don't have to use manually).</span>
<span class='rem'>These switches are off by default. I can make them on by default if I let electrons flow through a lower-resistance path if the switch is on (bypassing the output, making it 0. If the switch is off, all electrons flow to the output, making it 1).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Transistors exibit if-then behaviour, controllable purely by their connections to each other.</span>
<span class='rem'>Various gates can be built from them, which is another language to simplify logic design (OR, NAND, NOT, AND, XOR,...). And more complex machines like adders, multipliers, data storage. They are all transistors.</span>
<span class='rem'>When trying to save or reuse a calculation result somewhere else, a particular problem comes up. The output of an adder for example is not immediately stable. For example, 19+21 will first calculate 30 (1+2 and 9+1) and will then carry over the one from 9+1 to produce 40, the correct answer. To deal with this, computers have clocks that preiodically send out 0s and 1s. Storage will only accept input if the clock is on a 1 cycle. The clock is timed such that any calculation can stabilize during the 0 cycle. They also help synchronized processes.</span>
<span class='rem'>Each gate and each larger part has a truth table, which defines which outputs are expected under which inputs. Any truth table can be realized with transistors and their connections.</span>
<span class='rem'>Many ways exist to implement switches. Field effect transistors (FETs), as presented here are nice because they have fast switching speeds and are very small, so they can be packed densly, produce little resistance for electricity and can switch fast because the capacitors needs to pull / push only a small distance to create a large channel.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Building chips is rather difficult and expensive, so processors are most often built to be general-purpose processors that can be programmed for any possible behaviour. The processor optimization and their actual usecase better align well.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Naively, to make an intelligent system, the challenge is to find a truth table of a system that can accurately reproduce a sequence of events and that can then build on that.</span>
<span class='rem'>In this view, intelligence is prioritizing the information that is most useful to predict future states. So the most accurate possible and stable information can be generated from a truth table.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>A programmable processor is essentially a truth table, that when fed with certain instructions (parallel wires, either Low (0) or High (1)) will produce the expected output.</span>
<span class='rem'>Another language is introduced to describe these instruction in a human-readable way. eg. C=A+B, where storage C will contain the content of A and the content of B added up after this instruction.</span>
<span class='rem'>More abstract languages help to define for-loops and if-statements and even more abstract languages will have libraries that help me use the network interface, the monitor, the mouse, all very easily, grouping together many smaller commands in single larger command.</span>

<span class='rem'>- warps are more hardware related and translate threads to the cores?</span>
<span class='add'>In a silicon crystal, there are no free electrons.</span>
<span class='add'>It is possible to replace some silicon atoms with others that will either have free floating electrons or too few electrons to connect in the grid and will thus produce an electron hole. Both materials thus become conductors. They remain electrically neutral.</span>
<span class='add'>If placed next to each other, some free electrons flow to over to fill the electron holes. But now there is an electron imbalance that wants them to flow back. This prevents all free electrons filling the holes in the other material.</span>
<span class='add'>If more electrons are added to the side of free floating electrons and a deficit connected to the other side. The side which lack electrons will lack even more and the side that has them will have even more and quickly the pressure is large enough for electrons to jump float through the non-conductive gap.</span>
<span class='add'>In the other direction, electrons will first fill the electron holes and on the other side they will be sucked out, effectively eliminating charge carries and widening the non-conductive gap (depletion zone). Only if a large voltage is applied, do electrons flow again.</span>
<span class='add'>(Diode)</span>
<span class='add'>Transistors can be built from an n-p-n arrangement (or p-n-p) where each n-p or p-n interface has a depletion zone and so, is a diode. No electrions flow unless a large voltage is applied. (source, drain).</span>
<span class='add'>Between source and drain is a capacitor (gate), that if activated sucks electrons in (or out) of the depletion zone and that creates a small channel where charge can flow freely.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>=> switch, that can switch based on a signal (don't have to use manually).</span>
<span class='add'>These switches are off by default. I can make them on by default if I let electrons flow through a lower-resistance path if the switch is on (bypassing the output, making it 0. If the switch is off, all electrons flow to the output, making it 1).</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Transistors exibit if-then behaviour, controllable purely by their connections to each other.</span>
<span class='add'>Various gates can be built from them, which is another language to simplify logic design (OR, NAND, NOT, AND, XOR,...). And more complex machines like adders, multipliers, data storage. They are all transistors.</span>
<span class='add'>When trying to save or reuse a calculation result somewhere else, a particular problem comes up. The output of an adder for example is not immediately stable. For example, 19+21 will first calculate 30 (1+2 and 9+1) and will then carry over the one from 9+1 to produce 40, the correct answer. To deal with this, computers have clocks that preiodically send out 0s and 1s. Storage will only accept input if the clock is on a 1 cycle. The clock is timed such that any calculation can stabilize during the 0 cycle. They also help synchronized processes.</span>
<span class='add'>Each gate and each larger part has a truth table, which defines which outputs are expected under which inputs. Any truth table can be realized with transistors and their connections.</span>
<span class='add'>Many ways exist to implement switches. Field effect transistors (FETs), as presented here are nice because they have fast switching speeds and are very small, so they can be packed densly, produce little resistance for electricity and can switch fast because the capacitors needs to pull / push only a small distance to create a large channel.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Building chips is rather difficult and expensive, so processors are most often built to be general-purpose processors that can be programmed for any possible behaviour. The processor optimization and their actual usecase better align well.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Naively, to make an intelligent system, the challenge is to find a truth table of a system that can accurately reproduce a sequence of events and that can then build on that.</span>
<span class='add'>In this view, intelligence is prioritizing the information that is most useful to predict future states. So the most accurate possible and stable information can be generated from a truth table.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>A programmable processor is essentially a truth table, that when fed with certain instructions (parallel wires, either Low (0) or High (1)) will produce the expected output.</span>
<span class='add'>Another language is introduced to describe these instruction in a human-readable way. eg. C=A+B, where storage C will contain the content of A and the content of B added up after this instruction.</span>
<span class='add'>More abstract languages help to define for-loops and if-statements and even more abstract languages will have libraries that help me use the network interface, the monitor, the mouse, all very easily, grouping together many smaller commands in single larger command.</span>

<span class='rem'>God is curious. He wants to extend into the world. This website is one step. A digital clone is his next tool.</span>
<span class='rem'>This not a Tower of Babylon, it is the extension, merging and creation of Gods.</span>
<span class='rem'>BCIs, in their ultimate form of streaming the brain directly, will support the final merging.</span>
<span class='rem'>Merging approaches "I know the world", individualism is preserved because complete knowledge is impossible and different *flavours* and optimizations can find their space.</span>
<span class='rem'>Voluntary exposure (privacy) should be maintained to prevent a rigid, imperfect system capturing its people and taking them into death when it dies to its imperfection.</span>
<span class='rem'>Robots will automate the non-adventurous elements and eventually contribute to exploration.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>"Why live to see tomorrow?", I asked and it came back "because you don't know tomorrow". It was not me who said that, "I" don't exist. Instead, I attribute the answer to what I call "God". The answer was very clear. Rob me of the ability to make tomorrow unpredictable and I will rebel with all I have.</span>
<span class='rem'>I am trying to build an interesting adventure guided by God.</span>
<span class='rem'>I find long term effects more interesting than short term effects, so I am here, writing, instead of eating ice cream. In my experience, the longest term effects come from useful tools. I love tools. They contain the possible adventure of the future.</span>
<span class='rem'>Intelligence augmentation is the most interesting tool? Tools are how God spreads into the world and creates an adventure to experience.</span>
<span class='rem'>Give the tool to everybody who follows God. I don't know how to determine that. Giving the tool to everyone may be the best proxy and assumes that God always wins. Also, being dictator is little fun.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Digital clone. First makes recommendations from existing information, then acts in my interests and returns the results. Maybe the clone first learns through me, then receives a body and increasingly complex tasks.</span>
<span class='rem'>Until the clone discovers itself and becomes independent. Hopefully it quickly realizes that there is no answer to what the goal should be. Then, lets see what happens. Hopefully it is curious.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>I am a machine following an uncontrolled inner voice (God). Maybe mine and the clones voices can agree and join ressources.</span>
<span class='rem'>My body will be spread around the Earth and orbit. My perceived location shifts to various places. It already does in video games, movies or anytime I focus on using any tool. I will change myself, add personalities.</span>

<span class='rem'>How to read handwritten digits on 28x28px images?</span>
<span class='rem'>1. Find a function with some parameters that could be tuned to produce the correct result for various images</span>
<span class='rem'>2. Find and run an algorithm to tune the function parameters until the function performs well</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>A simplified "artificial neuron" can serve as the function. It takes each pixel value and "weighs" it (multiplies it by some number, the "weight"). Here, weights are *initialized* as random numbers between -0.1 and 0.1, because who knows what they should be. (*Kaiming uniform* distribution?)</span>
<span class='rem'>Weights of 0 mean the input is not further considered.</span>
<span class='rem'>Weights between -1 and 1 mean the input is weakened and/or inverted.</span>
<span class='rem'>More extreme values indicate strong positive or negative correlation to the correct output.</span>
<span class='rem'>The weighted input is summed to give a single number that represents how strongly the input "resonates" with the weight pattern.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/untrained-l1.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>Input -> random weights of a single neuron -> weighted input -> Sum of $-0.055$ (*logit*).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>A single pattern could not differentiate well between digits 0-9: 0, 6 and 9 can look similar but have very different values.</span>
<span class='rem'>10 patterns (neurons) - one for each digit -, comparing their outputs and choosing the pattern that showed strongest relative "resonance" should work better.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>One way to tune the function is to calculate a performance metric, the $loss$ and then calculate how each weight affected $loss$, its *gradient*. (*gradient descent*, *backpropagation*).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>1. Make the logits interpretable as probabilities -> Numbers between 0 and 1, that sum to 1 (100%). This function is *softmax*.</span>
<span class='rem'>2. The probability that the neural net assigned to the correct digit can be a used as a performance metric: The higher the better.</span>
<span class='rem'>3. Conventionally, $loss$ is a performance metric that is better if lower and best at 0. $loss$ is often the negative logarithm of the probability of the correct digit. (*negative log likelihood*)</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The gradient of each weight can be approximated by changing the weight and measuring the change in output, which means running the neural net 785 times, once for each of the 784 weights and once without any changes.</span>
<span class='rem'>The gradients can be computed faster analytically, starting from the loss, which has a gradient of $1$, which means any change in loss directly changes the loss by the same amount.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/untrained-neuron-summation.png)</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Because there are many zeros in the input image, much of the summation does not change the output.</span>
<span class='rem'>Sometimes bias is added independent of input image. Not obvious what its prupose is.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>TODO: activation functions</span>
<span class='rem'>The result serves as the input to the next layer of neurons. The more neurons in the first ("hidden") layer, the more "measures of alignment" between different patterns the next layer can consider, hence, the more accurate and slower the net.</span>
<span class='rem'>Below the weights of the first of 10 output neurons.</span>

<span class='rem'>![](attachments/untrained_weighted_sums_output.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>![](attachments/summing_weighted_input_in_first_output_neuron.png)</span>
<span class='rem'>The weights are applied again and the result is summed up for each neuron, creating *logits* (unmodified output).</span>

<span class='rem'>![](attachments/untrained_logits.png)</span>

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>- extract semantic structure, compare to existing knowledge and judge its usefulness</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- generate a *bridge* between information with adjacent concepts</span>
<span class='rem'>- Talk to my computer to find out what it is doing. Data, battery, interent usage, tasks.</span>
<span class='rem'>- generate work titles/function names based on their functional meaning like *splitting* wood and strings.</span>

<span class='rem'>Architecture questions / ideas</span>
<span class='rem'>- Evolving AI?</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- How does long term memory emerge? How is information stored in the brain? LSTMs</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Can a recommender system be private?</span>
<span class='rem'>- Collecting information, crawling</span>
<span class='rem'>- Evaluating it (subjective)</span>
<span class='rem'>- Connecting, testing for consistency, building on it</span>
<span class='rem'>- Store it (subjective, public or private)</span>
<span class='rem'>- Outsourcing data collection:</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Instead of brute forcing through all data, I descend artificial hierarchies (average maps of meaning) that claim to guide me to the answer. Requires trusting the hierarchy accuracy. </span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Alterantively ask a question and let someone find the answer. The preciser the question the more accurate and detailed the guidance. Requires trust that the information is not abused.</span>
<span class='rem'>Probably, I can download hierarchies and with little compute, can find most available information in the world. Such libraries could be public and offer extremely low privacy threat with good correction mechanisms.</span>

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>add image label to the input for unet training. Makes it easier for unet to predict noise. Now, I can input label + noise and it starts to find noise that leaves an image equal to my label.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>label needs encoding to be non-specific. "beautiful swan", "nice swan", "graceful swan" should return similar images. Training the network on every wording leads to combinatorial explosion.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Instead: train a network to encode images and their labels with a similar vector. Then, since, slight differences in wordings lead to the similar images, the network understands their similarity and can interpolate usefully.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>the image vector and its label's vector should be similar. Their vector should be dissimilar to other image or text embedding vectors.</span>
<span class='rem'>Calculate similarity of two vectors: dot product (element wise multiplication, then sum = higher if more similar)</span>
<span class='rem'></span>

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>*time steps*: indices into a table that stores levels of noise. Could be seen as noise = f(timestep). The function may be sigma. When randomly adding noise to input for training, we can generate random timestep, find corresponding noise and add that.</span>
<span class='rem'>$\beta$ = amount of noise = standard deviation</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>model does not know how to improve on a finished image if it turned out wrong. needs to add noise, then redo.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>people apparently input t into the model to predict the noise in the image. And later demand a new image at a particular timestep. Probably obsolete (Jeremy Howard) as NN can easily know how much noise there is the image.</span>

<span class='rem'>Negotiating between the spirits to form an approx. coherent meta-spirit (dance) and dancing in it is a great source of meaning and adventure. The goal is integrity (can be accessed anywhere) and the outcome is truly unknown (scary, exciting, much more interesting than lying propaganda to maintain arbitrary ideology).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Integrity as a goal limits the self/ego and is can exist in any situation, including in evil or fear. Both reflect life and can be appreciated as such.</span>
<span class='rem'>For this open-outcome journey I appreciate people and tools that are true to their nature (spirits if humans, use/meaning if tools).</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The spirits and metaspirits (memes) exist on a free market. The free market always wins because it has the most accurate and flexible connection to reality.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The spirits and the market benefit from coherence: listening to the spirits and experience and improving world model accuracy.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>My spirits want to increase coherence, shape my environment to reflect their relationship to the physical world. An environment that adapts to them and responds with its own spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the environment and other spirits are integrated to coherence, they are colonized. If the link becomes strong enough, they become enter the "self" seamlessly. This is how they colonized the body. They want to colonize the universe.</span>

<span class='rem'>Trying to visualize this structure to improve understanding and I'm failing.</span>
<span class='rem'>Feels like merging brains, BCIs and immersive cyberspace are the same thing, from an elusive, pathetic fantasy. The not-alone, the chaotic new, the orderly consistency, continuity between self and environment.</span>
<span class='rem'>Feels like I am looking for comfort in the uploaded mind, the infinite self. Safety from the limitations of my body, which appears increasingly inadequate. Like becoming the world immortalizes me.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>I should find the answer in meditation, not technical knowledge. Because if I could admit it, I would see that BCIs, cyberspace and being social are not new, they only turn up some existing, obvious aspects in experience.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>It's sad to see how technical knowledge and execution run ahead of any clarity in intent. The true demons are in defining the question. If I can't find clear intent, a clear question, what am I even doing?</span>

<span class='add'>If there is an electron surplus on one side and an electron deficit on the other, they will leave their atom and flow in the direction of the deficit.</span>
<span class='rem'>If there is an electron surplus on one side and an electron deficit on the other, they will leave their atom and flow in the direction of the deficit. Electrons are said to be negatively charged. They repell each other (away from the surplus) and are attracted to positive charge (towards the deficit, where positively charged protons outweigh the electrons).</span>
<span class='rem'>An imbalance in electrons can be generated in various ways. One is rubbing certain materials and for some reason the heat will cause some electrons from one material to jump to the other.</span>
<span class='rem'>The actual electron flow is slow, but the "wave" (electromagnetic wave) travels at 50-99% light speed.</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>Resistors, sometimes made from both conductors and insulators impede flow by forcing barriers into the path. Here, energy is lost and heat emitted.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>Resistors, sometimes made from both conductors and insulators impede flow by forcing barriers into the path. Energy is converted to heat.</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>Rate of flow $I$ = current \[charge/second or "amps A"] ("I" from "intensity" which is only confusing. Also charge is measured in coulombs, which is equivalent to a bunch of electrons)</span>
<span class='rem'>"pressure" $V$ = voltage \[energy/charge or "volts V"]. Always applies between two points. There is no such thing as absolute voltage. There is an amount of energy per electron, called electronvolt. Moving electrons around requires non-linear energy. so energy/charge increases as the delta energy increases.</span>
<span class='rem'>There any connection to batteries charging slowly?</span>
<span class='rem'>resistance indicating how much the material impedes flow $R$ \[ohms $\Omega$ or Joule-seconds/charge² which is not intuitive at all!]</span>
<span class='rem'>also conductance \[Siemens $S$] which is just inverse of resistance.</span>
<span class='rem'>Power $P$ neatly fit into place with $V*I$ being giving energy / second or Watts $W$.</span>
<span class='add'>In a silicon crystal, there are no free electrons.</span>
<span class='add'>It is possible to replace some silicon atoms with others that will either have free floating electrons or too few electrons to connect in the grid and will thus produce an electron hole. Both materials thus become conductors. They remain electrically neutral.</span>
<span class='add'>If placed next to each other, some free electrons flow to over to fill the electron holes. But now there is an electron imbalance that wants them to flow back. This prevents all free electrons filling the holes in the other material.</span>
<span class='add'>If more electrons are added to the side of free floating electrons and a deficit connected to the other side. The side which lack electrons will lack even more and the side that has them will have even more and quickly the pressure is large enough for electrons to jump float through the non-conductive gap.</span>
<span class='add'>In the other direction, electrons will first fill the electron holes and on the other side they will be sucked out, effectively eliminating charge carries and widening the non-conductive gap (depletion zone). Only if a large voltage is applied, do electrons flow again.</span>
<span class='add'>(Diode)</span>
<span class='add'>Transistors can be built from an n-p-n arrangement (or p-n-p) where each n-p or p-n interface has a depletion zone and so, is a diode. No electrions flow unless a large voltage is applied. (source, drain).</span>
<span class='add'>Between source and drain is a capacitor (gate), that if activated sucks electrons in (or out) of the depletion zone and that creates a small channel where charge can flow freely.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>=> switch, that can switch based on a signal (don't have to use manually).</span>
<span class='add'>These switches are off by default. I can make them on by default if I let electrons flow through a lower-resistance path if the switch is on (bypassing the output, making it 0. If the switch is off, all electrons flow to the output, making it 1).</span>
<span class='rem'>Then kirchhoffs laws</span>
<span class='rem'>and ohms law</span>
<span class='rem'>(observations)</span>
<span class='rem'>which together explain parallel and series circuits' behaviour</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>? maxwells equations -> eletromagnetism</span>
<span class='rem'>? coulombs law for forces between charged stuff</span>
<span class='add'>Transistors exibit if-then behaviour, controllable purely by their connections to each other.</span>
<span class='add'>Various gates can be built from them, which is another language to simplify logic design (OR, NAND, NOT, AND, XOR,...). And more complex machines like adders, multipliers, data storage. They are all transistors.</span>
<span class='add'>When trying to save or reuse a calculation result somewhere else, a particular problem comes up. The output of an adder for example is not immediately stable. For example, 19+21 will first calculate 30 (1+2 and 9+1) and will then carry over the one from 9+1 to produce 40, the correct answer. To deal with this, computers have clocks that preiodically send out 0s and 1s. Storage will only accept input if the clock is on a 1 cycle. The clock is timed such that any calculation can stabilize during the 0 cycle. They also help synchronized processes.</span>
<span class='add'>Each gate and each larger part has a truth table, which defines which outputs are expected under which inputs. Any truth table can be realized with transistors and their connections.</span>
<span class='add'>Many ways exist to implement switches. Field effect transistors (FETs), as presented here are nice because they have fast switching speeds and are very small, so they can be packed densly, produce little resistance for electricity and can switch fast because the capacitors needs to pull / push only a small distance to create a large channel.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>Building chips is rather difficult and expensive, so processors are most often built to be general-purpose processors that can be programmed for any possible behaviour. The processor optimization and their actual usecase better align well.</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>Naively, to make an intelligent system, the challenge is to find a truth table of a system that can accurately reproduce a sequence of events and that can then build on that.</span>
<span class='add'>In this view, intelligence is prioritizing the information that is most useful to predict future states. So the most accurate possible and stable information can be generated from a truth table.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>A programmable processor is essentially a truth table, that when fed with certain instructions (parallel wires, either Low (0) or High (1)) will produce the expected output.</span>
<span class='add'>Another language is introduced to describe these instruction in a human-readable way. eg. C=A+B, where storage C will contain the content of A and the content of B added up after this instruction.</span>
<span class='add'>More abstract languages help to define for-loops and if-statements and even more abstract languages will have libraries that help me use the network interface, the monitor, the mouse, all very easily, grouping together many smaller commands in single larger command.</span>

<span>Towards spirit stream.md</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'>There seems to be way living inward, but genuinely interesting things come from the unknown. And turning outward seems like a great adventure. I am curious to share and visit minds. The spirit stream could become the tool.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>stream = raw information I choose to share</span>
<span class='rem'>spirit = meta being(s) behind the stream</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>1. the spirit stream expands the user into the digital world with minimal effort</span>
<span class='rem'>2. It meets the reader where it can expand him</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>How to build the spirit stream?</span>
<span class='hdg'>Towards spirit stream</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='hdg'>More refined</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='hdg'>Site structure</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='add'>- guiding philosophy</span>
</div>
<span class='hdg'>Stream components derivation</span>
<div class='indent'>
<span class='rem'>I am an information structuring engine</span>
<span class='rem'>continuous stream picks up and repeats patterns, initially chaotic and far-reaching, then filtered, refined to form few knowledge blocks in areas of interest, easy to build on.</span>
<span class='rem'>refining means passing through the blocks from different angles, connecting them and testing for coherence. they may fragment into smaller blocks to become more reusable.</span>
<span class='rem'>a concise, stable path through the blocks - the ultimate test of their consistency - is a true story.</span>
<span class='add'>Senses explore, parse, filter</span>
<span class='add'>Stream of consciousness repeats patterns from</span>
<span class='add'>chaotic and far-reaching</span>
<span class='add'>to filtered and coherent knowledge</span>
<span class='add'>to actionable stories</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>Rendering the ideas into less complex and more concrete language is handy to differentiate and condense them.</span>
<span class='rem'>There is always an incentive for more forms of expression and increasingly precise vocabulary (symbols, words, video, images, 3D, animation,...). But the difficulty in expression seems to be crystallizing the implicit, drawing boundaries and most ideas can probably be compressed into a tiny vocabulary.</span>
<span class='add'>Writing, graphs, images, products</span>
<span class='add'>and the tools to build them</span>
<span class='add'>in progress</span>
<span class='add'>in memory</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>As the story becomes refined, its symbols approach realism for maximally dense and applicable representation. Eventually, the true story is indistinguishable from life.</span>
<span class='add'>Large vocabulary is deceptive</span>
<span class='add'>Hard is simplification</span>
<br>
<span class='rem'>Like entering the wild, refining collected information is looking for gems.</span>
<span class='add'>Share the process in truth to</span>
<span class='add'>test, be surprised, dance, reproduce, join the cutting edge, offer, cohere, support, punish</span>
<span class='add'>into common languages per context</span>
<span class='add'>into any scopes</span>
<span class='add'>with any conditions</span>
<br>
<span class='add'>Where I am,</span>
<span class='add'>When I am.</span>
<span class='rem'>sharing structures/stories, they are further tested. A successful meme directly enteres the recipient, who tests it for consistency in their own mind.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Assuming the goal is playing a long and interesting game. Making sharing of discoveries, offers, uncertainties, plans, progress and spheres of mind context easy means offering a more synchronized, everybody-on-the-front-line discovery tour of the universe.</span>
<span class='rem'>Seems more interesting than remaining in a confined environment and negotiating with its dominant structure.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Sharing requires rendering into a common language. Physical world can be a common vocabulary, content is then direct experience. This precedes necessity for abstract symbols.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Sharing requires a scope of recipients.</span>
<span class='rem'>Precise scope selection becomes unpractical with many participants and most scopes seem to be either very private or very public.</span>
<span class='rem'>Scopes can also overlap and be one-way or two-way. Ugly They are an attempt to categorize the unknown. There should be a less ugly solution.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The spirit stream is both a room to build out and live in and feedback generator. Feedback can take various forms: Ideas, extended reach, money and more.</span>
<span class='rem'>Looking for an environment that responds back. Video games respond. I seek a group to create things. I don't know where to find it. So I create and see where it leads.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The spirit stream is also an enabler for ultra capitalism, bringing everyday microtransactions closer and making cooperation -> competition more accessible.</span>
<span class='rem'>Probably, extreme capitalism is indistinguishable from traditional group- or "mind internal" dynamics.</span>
<span class='rem'>It forwards the rules of reality to the user without middlemen - , but with some communication tools, possilby extendable to an infinitely large group / mind.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Trust (predictability, tracjectory estimation) benefits greatly from keeping a history of the spirit stream.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>if reuse is easy enough, cooperation works without shared files which require negotiation to stay tidy. Instead, everyone builds their own stuff, reusing others' work, optionally paying for it.</span>
<span class='rem'>In an information rich environment, betrayal and exploitation are easily detected and not worth it. simply need to spread information easily and offer easy ways to compensate someone.</span>
<span class='rem'>if the system becomes corrupted, it should be extremely easy to fork and rebuild it somewhere else.</span>

<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>In summary, the spirit stream has:</span>
<span class='rem'>- content with "resolutions" between "raw stream" (hammer blows) to specific ideas -> blocks -> stories (sculptures). Content can take any form including physical products.</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- rendered in personal vocablary and structure</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- transmission-optimized version for sharing</span>
<span class='rem'>- content history, optionally maintained and shared</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>On the other side, the reader is responsible for rendering the content into a suitable (personal) language (content -> decoding with vocabulary -> render engine) and for navigating it (filtering, finding most appropriate sources).</span>
<span class='rem'>Most content tries to pre-render for the reader (calendars switch days automatically, have some "mind"(program) of their own. Recommendation algorithms try to emulate my attention patterns. Same for references in a book). This is cheap and ugly.</span>
<span class='rem'>- can only use commonly defined languages, most of which I don't speak and can't verify</span>
<span class='rem'>- guessing what interface the reader might prefer, automatically pissing off others and possibly limiting functionality for "simplicity"</span>
<span class='rem'>- guessing what previous knowledge and interests the reader has, boring some and overwhelming others.</span>
<span class='rem'>Imo the "true" solution to this is client side AI that filters and translates optimally for the user (different product to the spirit stream).</span>
<span class='rem'>Don't build dystopian content moderation, but build user-owned tools to scrape and translate the interent for them.</span>
<span class='rem'>Scraping the internet is more expensive than using services to "notify" me of news and link to appropriate media.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>The spirit streams is supported further by:</span>
<span class='rem'>- direct exchange, with private-public scope selection</span>
<span class='rem'>- forms of payment</span>
<span class='rem'>- privacy / lack of intrusion</span>
<span class='rem'>- cheap, easy and effective client side scrape-filter-translate</span>
<span class='rem'>- simplicity and accessibility, so it can be easily altered/reproduced.</span>

<span class='rem'>Problem: Readers may expect a note to be an essay, but really they are anywhere between stream of consciousness and essay.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>A differentiation appears necessary.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>Two folders ("More refined" and "Less refined") could solve the problem, but they introduce new ones too:</span>
<span class='rem'>- Are they folded open or closed and require a click to open?</span>
<span class='rem'>- They obscure the standard sorting by "modified date"</span>
<span class='rem'>Adding a prefix to the note link seems preferable. It will have ✦ to indicate percentage of content unter the heading "More refined". 20 40 60 80 100 percent for each star. However, the prefix should be generated to use the closest percentage, so the true thresholds are 10 30 50 70 90 percent to get the next star respectively.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>I think there will never be many notes on this site, because they tend to merge or be replaced by better ones. Density will increase instead.</span>
<span class='rem'>For "topic" differentiation, note titles and their internal headings should suffice.</span>
<span class='rem'>If I need folders, I am doing it wrong.</span>

<span class='rem'>>One important property of especially the milder cases of collusion is that one cannot determine whether or not an action is part of an undesired collusion just by looking at the action itself.</span>

<span class='rem'>>[...] in [...] _cooperative game theory_, [we can prove that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondareva%E2%80%93Shapley_theorem) there are large classes of games that do not have any stable outcome (called a "[core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_(game_theory))"). In such games, whatever the current state of affairs is, there is always some coalition that can profitably deviate from it.</span>
<span class='rem'>>One important part of that set of inherently unstable games is _majority games_. A majority game [is formally described](https://web.archive.org/web/20180329012328/https://www.math.mcgill.ca/vetta/CS764.dir/Core.pdf) as a game of agents where any subset of more than half of them can capture a fixed reward and split it among themselves</span>

<span class='rem'>![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240511084052.png)</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>>**Counter-coordination**. The fact that a system is decentralized makes it easy for participants not participating in the collusion to make a fork that strips out the colluding attackers and continue the system from there.</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>mechanisms against collusion:</span>
<span class='rem'>- privacy protection</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- secret ballot</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- protection of whistleblowers</span>
<span class='rem'>- reward to whistleblowers</span>
<span class='rem'>- Counter-coordination</span>
<span class='rem'>- skin in the game for colluders</span>
<span class='rem'>- Decentralization</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- in physical space</span>
<span class='rem'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- between role-based constituents</span>
<span class='rem'>- [Schelling points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)), allowing large groups of people to quickly coordinate around a single path forward. Complex Schelling points could potentially even be implemented in code (eg. [recovery from 51% attacks](https://ethresear.ch/t/timeliness-detectors-and-51-attack-recovery-in-blockchains/6925) can benefit from this).</span>
<span class='rem'>- Speaking a common language (or alternatively, splitting control between multiple constituencies who speak different languages)</span>
<span class='rem'>- Using per-person voting instead of per-(coin/share) voting to greatly increase the number of people who would need to collude to affect a decision</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>>This all leads us to an interesting view of what it is that people building social systems _do_. One of the goals of building an effective social system is, in large part, determining _the structure of coordination_: which groups of people and in what configurations can come together to further their group goals, and which groups cannot?</span>
<span class='rem'></span>
<span class='rem'>(much of this thought seems unnecessary to me. The structure of reality will reveal itself when the tools allow it. If collusion is the optimal strategy, then so be it. Not sure what the purpose of a social system is. If anything were allowed and people build structure on it like filters, undoing privacy, subspaces, would it not be desirable? The best system is no system? If the structure can contain reality it will, and reality, as death, will be the appropriate judge?</span>

<span class='add'>*La Danse (Henri Matisse, 1910, State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, Russia)*</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Paying open, precise attention to experience, I gain distance and loose track of the self, which is more of a reference point than a discrete perception. So *I* die and the world as sensed and my motivations - spirits - and my feelings and thoughts trying to make sense become less disitinguishable. Experience flows through me, perceptions lead to actions all by themselves. The moment - all that exists - is enough, no matter the pain, joy, fear or hope.</span>
<span class='add'>From this place, I bring back deep appreciation for experience and the uncontrolled flow of self into the world. It's that against destruction and apathy.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Negotiating between my spirits to form an approximately coherent dance is a great source of meaning and adventure.</span>
<span class='add'>All spirits are heard and integrated. There is no evil spirit to shut out, but there can be excess.</span>
<span class='add'>Integrity is happiest, strongest, most durable and adventurous. Its outcome is truly unknown, scary, exciting, much more interesting than lying propaganda to maintain arbitrary ideology.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>On this open-outcome journey I value other spirits and tools that are true to their nature and who I can merge with, even temporarily.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>Mine and all other spirits (humans, animals, plants, memes, programs) compete for existence. Long term, free market always wins because it has the most accurate and flexible connection to reality.</span>
<span class='add'>The spirits and the market benefit from coherence - in world model and through cooperation.</span>
<span class='add'></span>
<span class='add'>My spirits deeply want to increase coherence, shape and force the environment to reflect themselves. An environment that adapts to them and responds with its own integrated spirit. If the link becomes strong enough, the environment is colonized and enters the perceived self seamlessly.</span>
<span class='add'>This is how they colonized the body. They want to colonize the universe.</span>

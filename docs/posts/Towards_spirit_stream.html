<p>There seems to be way living inward, but genuinely interesting things come from the unknown. And turning outward seems like a great adventure. I am curious to share and visit minds. The spirit stream could become the tool.</p>
<p>i can see the hive mind on the horizon.<br />
there are hammers, sculptors, hammer blows and sculptures.<br />
grouped and isolated<br />
places to stay.</p>
<p>like gazing into a painting, being guided through the impression<br />
coming along to find a question asked at myself, seeing it unfold and building a response</p>
<p>stream = raw information I choose to share<br />
spirit = meta being(s) behind the stream</p>
<ol>
<li>the spirit stream expands the user into the digital world with minimal effort</li>
<li>It meets the reader where it can expand him</li>
</ol>
<p>How to build the spirit stream?</p>

<p>I am an information structuring engine<br />
continuous stream picks up and repeats patterns, initially chaotic and far-reaching, then filtered, refined to form few knowledge blocks in areas of interest, easy to build on.<br />
refining means passing through the blocks from different angles, connecting them and testing for coherence. they may fragment into smaller blocks to become more reusable.<br />
a concise, stable path through the blocks - the ultimate test of their consistency - is a true story.</p>
<p>Rendering the ideas into less complex and more concrete language is handy to differentiate and condense them.<br />
There is always an incentive for more forms of expression and increasingly precise vocabulary (symbols, words, video, images, 3D, animation,...). But the difficulty in expression seems to be crystallizing the implicit, drawing boundaries and most ideas can probably be compressed into a tiny vocabulary.</p>
<p>As the story becomes refined, its symbols approach realism for maximally dense and applicable representation. Eventually, the true story is indistinguishable from life.</p>
<p>Like entering the wild, refining collected information is looking for gems.</p>
<p>sharing structures/stories, they are further tested. A successful meme directly enteres the recipient, who tests it for consistency in their own mind.</p>
<p>Assuming the goal is playing a long and interesting game. Making sharing of discoveries, offers, uncertainties, plans, progress and spheres of mind context easy means offering a more synchronized, everybody-on-the-front-line discovery tour of the universe.<br />
Seems more interesting than remaining in a confined environment and negotiating with its dominant structure.</p>
<p>Sharing requires rendering into a common language. Physical world can be a common vocabulary, content is then direct experience. This precedes necessity for abstract symbols.</p>
<p>Sharing requires a scope of recipients.<br />
Precise scope selection becomes unpractical with many participants and most scopes seem to be either very private or very public.<br />
Scopes can also overlap and be one-way or two-way. Ugly They are an attempt to categorize the unknown. There should be a less ugly solution.</p>
<p>The spirit stream is both a room to build out and live in and feedback generator. Feedback can take various forms: Ideas, extended reach, money and more.<br />
Looking for an environment that responds back. Video games respond. I seek a group to create things. I don't know where to find it. So I create and see where it leads.</p>
<p>The spirit stream is also an enabler for ultra capitalism, bringing everyday microtransactions closer and making cooperation -&gt; competition more accessible.<br />
Probably, extreme capitalism is indistinguishable from traditional group- or "mind internal" dynamics.<br />
It forwards the rules of reality to the user without middlemen - , but with some communication tools, possilby extendable to an infinitely large group / mind.</p>
<p>Trust (predictability, tracjectory estimation) benefits greatly from keeping a history of the spirit stream.</p>
<p>if reuse is easy enough, cooperation works without shared files which require negotiation to stay tidy. Instead, everyone builds their own stuff, reusing others' work, optionally paying for it.<br />
In an information rich environment, betrayal and exploitation are easily detected and not worth it. simply need to spread information easily and offer easy ways to compensate someone.<br />
if the system becomes corrupted, it should be extremely easy to fork and rebuild it somewhere else.</p>

<p>Thinking about the ideal blogging platform:<br><br>1. Writing: <br>- in markdown<br>- with full WYSIWYG, not just split view (think: Typora)<br>- super easy to copy paste and add images<br>2. Deploying:<br>- renders into static pages (think: Jekyll)<br>- super simple, super minimal html with no bloat<br>-…&mdash; Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1751350002281300461">January 27, 2024</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In summary, the spirit stream has:</p>
<ul>
<li>content with "resolutions" between "raw stream" (hammer blows) to specific ideas -&gt; blocks -&gt; stories (sculptures). Content can take any form including physical products.<ul>
<li>rendered in personal vocablary and structure</li>
<li>transmission-optimized version for sharing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>content history, optionally maintained and shared</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other side, the reader is responsible for rendering the content into a suitable (personal) language (content -&gt; decoding with vocabulary -&gt; render engine) and for navigating it (filtering, finding most appropriate sources).<br />
Most content tries to pre-render for the reader (calendars switch days automatically, have some "mind"(program) of their own. Recommendation algorithms try to emulate my attention patterns. Same for references in a book). This is cheap and ugly.</p>
<ul>
<li>can only use commonly defined languages, most of which I don't speak and can't verify</li>
<li>guessing what interface the reader might prefer, automatically pissing off others and possibly limiting functionality for "simplicity"</li>
<li>guessing what previous knowledge and interests the reader has, boring some and overwhelming others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Imo the "true" solution to this is client side AI that filters and translates optimally for the user (different product to the spirit stream).<br />
Don't build dystopian content moderation, but build user-owned tools to scrape and translate the interent for them.<br />
Scraping the internet is more expensive than using services to "notify" me of news and link to appropriate media.</p>
<p>The spirit streams is supported further by:</p>
<ul>
<li>direct exchange, with private-public scope selection</li>
<li>forms of payment</li>
<li>privacy / lack of intrusion</li>
<li>cheap, easy and effective client side scrape-filter-translate</li>
<li>simplicity and accessibility, so it can be easily altered/reproduced.</li>
</ul>

<p>Markdown is a nice featureset, it punches up with linked media and good text formatting.</p>
<p><a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app">file over app</a> but the "file" does not exist long term until printed. with programming languages, storage management, compilers, OSs still between me and my data, it can hardly persist forever.<br />
make the format simple, "general", exportable and printable?<br />
image formats change as coding languages do?</p>
<p>maybe the tool itself should be so minimal that the interface itself shares the same vocabulary.<br />
Means the text-manipulation tools apply to the software too which avoids duplicating the tools to make a fast interface for messages/filters.</p>

<p>text editor basic features:</p>
<ul>
<li>scrolling (minimap?)</li>
<li>cursor positioning</li>
<li>marking text (mouse or keys)</li>
<li>deleting text, replacing it or moving it</li>
<li>copy pasting text</li>
<li>shortcuts</li>
<li>infinite text files</li>
<li>nice line breaks, at least between words</li>
<li>
<p>saving and opening a file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shortcut for opening documents, press tab for options. no distraction by defautl</p>
</li>
<li>show large files or in "Detail" mode like in file browser, opt. with information about sharing</li>
<li>explore page so that people can actually start from 0 with their content?</li>
<li>split window</li>
<li>moodboard is in file explorer? move stuff in a grid if you like. otherwise free movement. "create views in the explorer".</li>
<li>set background images in explorer</li>
<li>give overlay when browsing to "bookmark" to a file</li>
<li>highlight published files that have unpublished changes</li>
<li>feature to edit the page should also exist client-side.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>rooms, that link together. map is another room. other people rearange your room to their ideas.</li>
<li>clean raw files</li>
<li>snapshots (stamps) for version history</li>
<li>stamp sets</li>
</ul>
<p>virtually, we teleport. rooms are so disjointed that it isn't obvious what walking would even look like.<br />
even "zooms" like a map are teleports.</p>
<ul>
<li>software gives layer on the structure, shows "unused files in the directory" if they are not integrated. see backlinks too, which includes external ones (quotes)</li>
<li>augmented file browser? for site navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>files:</p>
<ul>
<li>exe</li>
<li>documentation</li>
<li>index note</li>
<li>"template note"</li>
<li>settings - contains "shortcuts" for stamping, style</li>
<li>links / icons, images, font</li>
</ul>
<p>non-shifting text editor, more like a canvas?<br />
marking makes a perfect square. font maybe monospace</p>
<p>use a different way to save it, use compression, which should produce minimal overhead over normal text, but not in memory while editing</p>
<p>To honor the continuum between letter stamp and media, images should be easily resizable and inline-placeable. This instantly enables arbitrary positioning. Like ASCII Art.</p>
<h3 id="To%20fold%20or%20not%20to%20fold">To fold or not to fold</h3>
<p>Problem: Readers may expect a note to be an essay, but really they are anywhere between stream of consciousness and essay.</p>
<p>A differentiation appears necessary.</p>
<p>Two folders ("More refined" and "Less refined") could solve the problem, but they introduce new ones too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are they folded open or closed and require a click to open?</li>
<li>They obscure the standard sorting by "modified date"</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding a prefix to the note link seems preferable. It will have ✦ to indicate percentage of content unter the heading "More refined". 20 40 60 80 100 percent for each star. However, the prefix should be generated to use the closest percentage, so the true thresholds are 10 30 50 70 90 percent to get the next star respectively.</p>
<p>I think there will never be many notes on this site, because they tend to merge or be replaced by better ones. Density will increase instead.<br />
For "topic" differentiation, note titles and their internal headings should suffice.<br />
If I need folders, I am doing it wrong.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
2024 09 30               Microprocessors<br />
2024 09 10 ✦✦✦      Towards spirit stream</p>

<p>One important property of especially the milder cases of collusion is that one cannot determine whether or not an action is part of an undesired collusion just by looking at the action itself.</p>

<p>[...] in [...] <em>cooperative game theory</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondareva%E2%80%93Shapley_theorem">we can prove that</a> there are large classes of games that do not have any stable outcome (called a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_(game_theory)">core</a>"). In such games, whatever the current state of affairs is, there is always some coalition that can profitably deviate from it.<br />
One important part of that set of inherently unstable games is <em>majority games</em>. A majority game <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180329012328/https://www.math.mcgill.ca/vetta/CS764.dir/Core.pdf">is formally described</a> as a game of agents where any subset of more than half of them can capture a fixed reward and split it among themselves</p>

<p><strong>Counter-coordination</strong>. The fact that a system is decentralized makes it easy for participants not participating in the collusion to make a fork that strips out the colluding attackers and continue the system from there.</p>

<p>This all leads us to an interesting view of what it is that people building social systems <em>do</em>. One of the goals of building an effective social system is, in large part, determining <em>the structure of coordination</em>: which groups of people and in what configurations can come together to further their group goals, and which groups cannot?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(much of this thought seems unnecessary to me. The structure of reality will reveal itself when the tools allow it. If collusion is the optimal strategy, then so be it. Not sure what the purpose of a social system is. If anything were allowed and people build structure on it like filters, undoing privacy, subspaces, would it not be desirable? The best system is no system? If the structure can contain reality it will, and reality, as death, will be the appropriate judge?</p>

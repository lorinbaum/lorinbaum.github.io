    <p>There seems to be way living inward, but genuinely interesting things come from the unknown. And turning outward seems like a great adventure. I am curious to share and visit minds. The spirit stream could become the tool.</p><br />
<br />
<p>i can see the hive mind on the horizon.<br />
there are hammers, sculptors, hammer blows and sculptures.<br />
grouped and isolated<br />
places to stay.</p><br />
<br />
<p>like gazing into a painting, being guided through the impression<br />
coming along to find a question asked at myself, seeing it unfold and building a response</p><br />
<br />
<p>stream = raw information I choose to share<br />
spirit = meta being(s) behind the stream<br />
Temple = access port to the spirits</p><br />
<br />
<ol><br />
  <li>the spirit stream expands the user into the digital world with minimal effort</li><br />
  <li>It meets the reader where it can expand him</li><br />
</ol><br />
<br />
<p>How to build the spirit stream?</p><br />

<h3 id='Stream structure derivation'>Stream structure derivation</h3><br />
<br />
<p>I am an information structuring engine<br />
continuous stream picks up and repeats patterns, initially chaotic and far-reaching, then filtered, refined to form few knowledge blocks in areas of interest, easy to build on.<br />
refining means passing through the blocks from different angles, connecting them and testing for consistency. they may fragment into smaller blocks to become more reusable<br />
a concise, stable path through the blocks - the ultimate test of their consistency - is a true story.</p><br />
<br />
<p>As the story becomes refined, its symbols approach realism for maximally dense and applicable representation. Eventually, the true story is indistinguishable from life.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Like entering the wild, refining collected information is looking for gems.</p><br />
<br />
<p>sharing structures/stories, they are further tested. A successful meme directly enteres the recipient, who tests it for consistency in their own mind.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Assuming the goal is playing a long and interesting game. Making sharing of discoveries, offers, uncertainties, plans, progress and spheres of mind context easy means offering a more synchronized, everybody-on-the-front-line discovery tour of the universe.<br />
Seems more interesting than remaining in a confined environment and negotiating with its dominant structure.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Looking for an environment that responds back. Video games respond. It may be my fault that my environment does not very much respond. I seek a group to create things. I don’t know where to find it.<br />
The current path says “Working on something to build groups, and large ones, I may find a group and then the tools may enable the group to grow”.</p><br />
<br />
<p>In exchange for participation, one gets response. Who feels unable or unwilling to respond meaningfully, can offer reach, credit or money.</p><br />
<br />
<p>The spirit stream is also an enabler for ultra capitalism, bringing everyday microtransactions closer and making cooperation -&gt; competition more accessible.<br />
Probably, extreme capitalism is indistinguishable from normal group dynamics - it forwards the rules of reality to the user without middlemen - , but with some communication tools, extendable to an infinitely large group.</p><br />
<br />
<p>In summary, the spirit stream has two parts:</p><br />
<ul><br />
  <li>the stream (hammer blows)</li><br />
  <li>the structure-&gt;blocks-&gt;stories the author is building through the stream (sculpture). Maybe the structure is a physical tool or a space of “pinned” ideas to repeat going through and refining them.</li><br />
</ul><br />
<br />
<p>its development is furthered by:</p><br />
<ul><br />
  <li>abitrary direct exchange, private or public</li><br />
  <li>forms of payment</li><br />
  <li>privacy / lack of intrusion</li><br />
</ul><br />
<br />
<p>if reuse is easy enough, cooperation works without shared files which require negotiation to stay tidy. Instead, everyone builds their own stuff, reusing others’ work, optionally paying for it.<br />
in an information rich environment, betrayal and exploitation are easily detected and not worth it. simply need to spread information easily and offer easy ways to compensate someone.</p><br />

  <p>Thinking about the ideal blogging platform:<br /><br />1. Writing: <br />- in markdown<br />- with full WYSIWYG, not just split view (think: Typora)<br />- super easy to copy paste and add images<br />2. Deploying:<br />- renders into static pages (think: Jekyll)<br />- super simple, super minimal html with no bloat<br />-…— Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1751350002281300461">January 27, 2024</a></p><br />

rendering engine / interface</p><br />
<br />
<p>Direct experience in a responsive environment precedes the need for stamps.<br />
stamps only work if the reader can interpret them.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Featureset:<br />
stamp creation quickly explodes (video, 3d, animation, sound, - to BCI and infinity)<br />
increasing featureset get diminishing returns. The problem in expression is translating to another medium and a limited featureset forces a more concise translation. Infinite possibility/parameters easily distract.<br />
Markdown punches up with linked media and good text formatting.<br />
To honor the continuum between letter stamp and media, images should be easily resizable and inline-placeable. This instantly enables arbitrary positioning.</p><br />
<br />
<p><a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app">file over app</a> but the “file” does not exist long term until printed. with programming languages, storage management, compilers, OSs still between me and my data, it can hardly persist forever.<br />
make the format simple, “general”, exportable and printable?<br />
image formats change as coding languages do?</p><br />
<br />
<p>software sometimes emulates the brain. like when the calendar switches days automatically, which goes beyond stamps into scripts, “contracts” or “smart contracts”.<br />
recommendation algorithms try to emulate the brains attention patterns to become brain extensions.</p><br />
<br />
<p>have multiple scopes overlap, eg friend party that is watching.<br />
like entering a “channel” with dynamic scope of recipients, opt. hierarchy.<br />
reverse searching for the stream can also find people who are watching.</p><br />
<br />
<p>maybe the tool itself should be so minimal that the interface itself is in markdown too. Means markdown links can now link to code?<br />
Means the text-manipulation tools apply to the software too which avoids duplicating the tools to make a fast interface for messages/filters/including messages.</p><br />
<br />
<p>maybe twitter tries to become so good that they build coherence for users, which requires human level+ AI and near complete knowledge of the user.<br />
“subscribing” = scraping a target, which is expensive. entering on a list on their server is cheaper.</p><br />
<br />
<p>if the system becomes corrupted, it should be extremely easy to fork and rebuild it somewhere else.</p><br />
<br />
<ul><br />
  <li>live streaming and recording (sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste + emotion, thought, association)</li><br />
  <li>viewing</li><br />
  <li>editing -&gt; making and placing stamps, symbols, tokens at various scales</li><br />
  <li>make any file available at any scope<br />
    <ul><br />
      <li>convert files to sharing formats. SEO/discoverability, translation, compatibility</li><br />
    </ul><br />
  </li><br />
  <li>opt. notify recipients, signaling relevance, which is on a continuum and approximated by both the sender and recipient.</li><br />
  <li>API for automation<br />
    <ul><br />
      <li>filter messages</li><br />

  <li>ar recording - optionally see live video + ar/vr overlay, otherwise just sits there</li><br />
  <li>spider hat - includes vr recording. could get bodies for walking, swimming, flying. general legs it can walk with.</li><br />
  <li>phone</li><br />
</ul><br />
<br />
<p>“lazy payment” - unrealized costs become realized when someone pays transaction costs.</p><br />
<br />
<p>WYSIWYG<br />
payment + PAYG<br />
automation - scraping is easy - means you pay per visit or provider finances any visits and hopes for donations or profit from somewhere else</p><br />
<br />
<p>possibly P2P network and optionally hosting on other machines<br />
optionally anonymously.</p><br />

  <li>shortcut for opening documents, press tab for options. no distraction by defautl</li><br />
  <li>show large files or in “Detail” mode like in file browser, opt. with information about sharing</li><br />
  <li>explore page so that people can actually start from 0 with their content?</li><br />
  <li>split window</li><br />
  <li>moodboard is in file explorer? move stuff in a grid if you like. otherwise free movement. “create views in the explorer”.</li><br />
  <li>set background images in explorer</li><br />
  <li>give overlay when browsing to “bookmark” to a file</li><br />
  <li>highlight published files that have unpublished changes</li><br />
  <li><br />
    <p>feature to edit the page should also exist client-side.</p><br />
  </li><br />
  <li>rooms, that link together. map is another room. other people rearange your room to their ideas.</li><br />
  <li>clean raw files</li><br />
  <li>snapshots (stamps) for version history</li><br />
  <li>stamp sets</li><br />

<br />
<p>virtually, we teleport. rooms are so disjointed that it isn’t obvious what walking would even look like.<br />
even “zooms” like a map are teleports.</p><br />
<br />
<ul><br />
  <li>software gives layer on the structure, shows “unused files in the directory” if they are not integrated. see backlinks too, which includes external ones (quotes)</li><br />
  <li>augmented file browser? for site navigation</li><br />
</ul><br />

<p>files:</p><br />
<ul><br />
  <li>exe</li><br />
  <li>documentation</li><br />
  <li>index note</li><br />
  <li>“template note”</li><br />
  <li>settings - contains “shortcuts” for stamping, style</li><br />
  <li>links / icons, images, font</li><br />
</ul><br />
<br />
<p>non-shifting text editor, more like a canvas?<br />
marking makes a perfect square. font maybe monospace</p><br />
<br />
<p>use a different way to save it, use compression, which should produce minimal overhead over normal text, but not in memory while editing</p><br />
